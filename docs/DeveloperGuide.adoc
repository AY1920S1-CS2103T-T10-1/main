Please follow this style rules

1.
Any line must be strictly less than 80 characters width. Exceptions being
tables or image captions.

(Why: Display vs physical lines using hjkl on vim makes long lines very mafan)

2.
Captions are as such

.The caption
image::LinkToDiagram.png[]

Ensure you use this notation so that Figure numbers are automatically added.
It is also preferable not to reference figure numbers at all.

3.
Indent long lines in lists appropriately ->

* Very long line Very long line Very long line Very long line Very long line
  Very long line
^^
indented

4.
Entire paragraphs should be typed out as entire paragraphs.

So, instead of:

This is the first sentence.
This is the second sentence of the paragraph that is very long and will
overrun the character limit.
But is still in the same paragraph.

Do this:

This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence of the graph that is
very long and will overrun the character limit. But is still in one paragraph.

(Why: when I read, it looks like separate lines but is actually not.)

5.
Keep opening and closing backticks on the same line while conforming within
the character limit.

do this:

Long line Long line Long line Long line Long line Long line Long
`Backticked word`

instead of:

Long line Long line Long line Long line Long line Long line Long `Backticked
word`

(This is to preserve syntax highlighting, so I can see if backticked words
or anything aren't properly escaped or formatted)

6.
Use macros as much as possible, see preamble.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the
App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
They are responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and
  connects them up with each other.

* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where
  necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used byx
multiple other components. The following class plays an important role at the
architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log
  file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the
  hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines
it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each
other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`,
`ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these,
including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are
defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view`
folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the
  modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `JarvisParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult`
  object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to
  perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic`
component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteAddressCommandParser` should end at the destroy
marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end
of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the `HistoryManager` data
* Stores the `FinanceTracker` data
* Stores the `CcaTracker` Data
* Stores the `CoursePlanner` Data
* Stores the `Planner` data

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` API is responsible for reading and writing data in
json format. This allows the application is remember information in
json format when the user closes the application.

Below is a class diagram involving the `Storage` interface, which
inherits from feature specific storage interfaces.

.Storage Interface
image::storage/StorageInterfaceClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `HistoryManager`, `FinanceTracker`, `CcaTracker`,
`CoursePlanner` and `Planner` data in json format and read it back.

The concrete class `StorageManager` implements `Storage` and manages
the storage for `UserPrefs`, `FinanceTracker`, `CcaTracker`,
`CoursePlanner`, `Planner` and `HistoryManager`.

Below is a class diagram of `StorageManager`.

.`StorageManager` class
image::storage/UpdatedStorageClassDiagram.png[]

Each feature of JARVIS is able to save its information to local storage
in `JSON` format, by adapting each feature component into
`JsonSerializable{Component Name}` class.

Below are the class diagrams for these adapted classes.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.jarvis.commons` package.

== Implementation

T   his section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are
implemented.

=== Undo / Redo Feature

This section covers in detail the undo/redo feature of JARVIS.

We will cover these main points:

* Design Considerations
* Feature Details
* Implementations
* User Scenario demonstrating undo/redo

Let's explore how we decided to implement the undo/redo feature in the Design
Considerations section below.

==== Design Considerations
There were several available behavioral design patterns that we were
considering to adopt to implement our undo/redo feature in the application.

* Command Pattern
* Memento Pattern

These patterns are common useful patterns to enable undo/redo functions.
These are also viable options as our application design allows both of these
approaches to be integrated easily.

Let’s see how these adopting each of these approaches will span out in the
development of the application.

===== Command Pattern Approach

The application already makes use of the command pattern to decouple the
internal state of the application and the user action. Therefore implementing
undo/redo function with the command pattern would require us to achieve the
following things:

1.  Implement a class, `HistoryManager` to manage and store commands that
have been done/undone in chronological sequence to facilitate undo and redo
functions. This should be facilitated with the use of two `Deque`/`Stack`
like structures. One will be fore storing the commands that have been done,
while the other will be storing the commands that have been undone.
2. Implement ways to discern amongst commands that should be added to
`HistoryManager`, whereby undoable commands should be added, while
non-undoable commands should not be added.
3. Implement the inverse operation of commands that can be undone.
4. Integrate `HistoryManager` into `Model` by Implementing undo and redo
operations in `HistoryManager` to execute on the `Model` it is associated
with and expose these operations to the `Model`. An undo operation will
remove the latest done command and execute its inverse operation onto the
`Model` before it is added as the latest undone command. A redo operation
will remove the latest undone command and execute its normal execution on
the `Model` before it is added as the latest done command.
5. Implement commands, `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`, along with their
respective parsers, `UndoCommandParser` and `RedoCommandParser`.
6. Integrate commands and parsers into `JarvisParser`.
7. Integrate logic in `LogicManager` to add undoable commands to
`HistoryManager`.
8. Implement storage for `HistoryManager` by implementing a `JSON`
serializable `HistoryManager` along with the `JSON` adapted commands it
stores so it can be written to a `JSON` file in local storage.
9. Integrate the logic to save `HistoryManager` to local storage in
`LogicManager` after the successful execution of commands.

===== Characteristics
* Space efficient due to storing commands instead of states of the entire
application. Efficient usage of RAM and local storage for the application.
* Commands logic will be more complex as they must know how to undo its
execution. Commands contain more data to retain information needed to undo
its execution.
* Complex inverse executions may be unnecessarily convoluted compared other
approaches (such as the memento pattern). This involves more planning and
support on the classes that commands execute on.
* Requires implementation and testing of each command (and future commands)
to enable undo/redo function with respect to that command. Development of the
application will involve more overhead when integrating new commands to the
application as there are more behaviour to test.
* Development of `HistoryManager` scales along with commands that are added
to the application. Even after `HistoryManager` is developed and integrated
into the application, additional work is required with each command, such as
supporting inverse execution and serializing the command (for local storage).
This can affect development schedule and add time constraints when working
with tight deadlines.

===== Memento Pattern Approach

The application follows a structural facade pattern, storing the data in
`ModelManager` which implements the `Model`, which is an interface for
commands to interact with. `ModelManager` manages classes that wrap their
respective data. Therefore implementing undo/redo function with the command
pattern would require us to achieve the following things:

1. Implement a `Version` class. This class wraps the state of another class
as an immutable “snapshot”.
2. Define the interface `VersionedModel` that extends `Model` with additional
methods to save its current state and to change its state. `VersionedModel`
could be viewed as a _originator_ class that can produce “snapshots” of its
own state and update its state from “snapshots”. These “snapshots” are in
wrapped in the above `Version` class.
3. Let `ModelManager` implement `VersionedModel` along with its methods to
allow `ModelManager` to produce `Version` objects containing its current state
and to update `ModelManager` to a state provided by a given `Version`.
4. Implement a `HistoryManager` class to facilitate as a _caretaker_ class.
`HistoryManager` will store a series of `Version` objects containing states of
the `VersionedModel` in two `Deque`/`Stack` like structures. One will be to
store the previous versions, while the other is to store the future versions
that were undone from.
5. Implement commands, `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`, along with their
respective parsers, `UndoCommandParser` and `RedoCommandParser`.
6. Update commands to take in both `VersionedModel` and `HistoryManager`
as arguments in their execute methods so that undo/redo commands can get
`Version` objects containing previous or subsequent states of
`VersionedModel` from `HistoryManager` for `VersionedModel` to update to.
7. Integrate commands and parsers into `JarvisParser`.
8. Implement storage for `HistoryManager` by implementing a `JSON`
serializable `HistoryManager` along with the `JSON` adapted `Version` so
that it can be written to a `JSON` file in local storage.
9. Integrate the logic to save `HistoryManager` to local storage in
`LogicManager` after the successful executions of commands.

===== Characteristics
* Expensive on space due to storing multiple copies of the application
state. This increases the usage of RAM and local storage for the
application.
* Simple robust implementation that can be developed quickly, which can be
useful for tight schedules in the development process.
* Protects the encapsulation of private data of the application state
(provided local storage data is also encrypted). This prevents violation of
encapsulation of classes.
* Development of `HistoryManager` scales with how the information to be
remembered changes. Whenever the nature of the information to be remembered
changes, the memento class `Version` needs to be updated along with how
`VersionedModel` updates and saves its state. Adding new commands also do not
require any changed to `HistoryManager` unless there are changes to the data
fields to be saved in `Model`.

===== Our Thoughts
These are the following questions we asked ourselves when deciding between
these two approaches

* RAM and storage
* Development process
* Software design principles

===== RAM and storage

Since storing commands is more space efficient than storing states of the
`Model`, the command pattern will occupy less space than the memento pattern.

Being space efficient will allow us to increase the range of undo/redo
function of the application.

Considering the target user group being students, we also want to develop an
application that would not consume too much RAM or local storage given
students budgets and varying tiers of laptops.

Therefore regarding this aspect, we favor command pattern over the memento
pattern.

===== Development process

The memento pattern will require us to update `HistoryManager` whenever the
`Model` changes, while the command pattern will require us to implement
inverse executions for each additional command.

Therefore the memento pattern would require more overhead when changing the
`Model` of the application while the command pattern require more overhead
when adding undoable commands.

Our application are subject to both of these changes such as changes to the
`Model` and adding new commands. Therefore both patterns are similar in
overhead and depends on the frequency of changes made to `Model` or adding
new commands. We feel that both options are viable and would be feasible for
our team in the development of this application.

===== Software Design Principles

Both patterns would involve introducing dependency between `Model` and
`HistoryManager`.

The memento pattern would involve `HistoryManager` having a unidirectional
dependency to `VersionedModel` while introducing `HistoryManager` as a
dependency to `Command`.

The command pattern would involve `HistoryManager` having dependency with
`Model`. We can choose to nest `HistoryManager` into `Model` which would
increase coupling between the two classes by introducing bidirectional
dependency. We may choose to introduce this coupling to prevent increasing
the dependency between `Command` as command will just be associated with
`Model`.

Both patterns involve `HistoryManager` with the responsibility of keeping
track of commands/states. Single Responsibility Principle is not violated
in both approaches.

===== Design Choice

We determined that going along with the command pattern. We want to cater
this application to students whose laptops may not have generous amounts of
RAM. On top of the fact that students typically use their browsers
_extensively_, we felt that we should be mindful of RAM usage.

Comparisons between command pattern and memento pattern with respect to the
development process were trivial since the `Model` and command sets are
already planned, and future changes to `Model` and commands would not have
any serious drawback regardless of the approach.

The section below will discuss feature details and characteristics we have
considered that would influence the logic of how we implement undo/redo.

==== Feature Details

The application should be able to undo and redo changes made by commands to
give the user more flexibility in their inputs. Undo and redo operations
should also be undo or redo multiple commands in a command. In the event that
a undo/redo command that comprises of multiple undo/redo operations fails at
any point, all changes made by the command should be rolled back. This is
reflected in the Activity Diagram below:

.Activity Diagram for undo and redo commands
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

Therefore there is a need to remember commands that change the state of the
`Model`. Commands that just render a view without actually changing the
application should not be stored as it does not make sense to undo or redo
them. We will distinguish these types of commands into two categories,
*invertible commands* and *non-invertible commands*.

* *Invertible commands* -- commands that mutate the state of the `Model` and
  should be stored for undo/redo functions.

* *Non-invertible commands* -- commands that do not mutate the state of the
  `Model` and should not be stored for undo/redo functions.

[NOTE]
Undo and redo commands will be considered non-invertible commands even though
they technically change the state of the `Model`. The reason is that they are
commands facilitating the undo and redo operation, thus they should not be
stored.

The following activity diagram illustrates how commands are remembered when a
user types in a command:

.Activity Diagram for how commands are remembered after their successful execution
image::CommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The section below will discuss in more detail how undo/redo is implemented.

==== Implementation
The undo/redo feature mechanism is facilitated by `HistoryManager`.
`HistoryManager` remembers *invertible commands*. These commands are stored
internally in two `CommandDeque` objects, `executedCommands` and
`inverselyExecutedCommands`. `CommandDeque` serve as custom `Deque` data
structure, which stores the latest added command to the top.

An undo operation would comprise of taking the latest executed command from
`executedCommands`, inversely executing it, and adding it to
`inverselyExecutedCommands`. A redo operation would comprise of a taking the
latest inversely executed command from `inverselyExecutedCommands`, executing
it, and adding it to `executedCommands`.

`Model` supports operations to facilitate undo and redo capabilities by
extending the `HistoryModel` which has the following operations:

* `Model#getHistoryManager()` -- Gets the `HistoryManager` instance.

* `Model#setHistoryManager(HistoryManager)` -- Resets the `HistoryManager`
  data to the given `HistoryManager` in the argument.

* `Model#getAvailableNumberOfExecutedCommands()` -- Gets the maximum available
  number of commands that can be undone.

* `Model#getAvailableNumberOfInverselyExecutedCommands()` -- Gets the maximum
  available number of commands that can be redone.

* `Model#canRollback()` -- Checks if it is possible to undo a command at the
  given state.

* `Model#canCommit()` -- Checks if it is possible to redo a command at the
  given state.

* `Model#rememberExecutedCommand(Command)` -- Remembers the given `Command`
  and stores it in `executedCommands` to facilitate undo capability for this
  command.

* `Model#rememberInverselyExecutedCommand(Command)` -- Remembers the given
  `Command` and stores it in `inverselyExecutedCommands` to facilitate redo
  capability for this command.

* `Model#rollback()` -- Inversely executes the latest command stored in
  `executedCommands` to revert the changes of the latest executed command
  made onto `Model`.

* `Model#commit()` -- Executes the latest undone command stored in
  `inverselyExecutedCommands` to reapply the changes that were made onto
  `Model` by the latest undone command.

Commands support the given operations to mutate the state of the `Model` and
to check if they should be stored for undo/redo function:

* `Command#hasInverseExecution()` -- Checks if the command's execution mutates
  the state of the `Model`, which is used to determine if the command should
  be remembered by `HistoryManager`.

* `Command#execute(Model)` -- Executes the command on the given `Model`.

* `Command#executeInverse(Model)` -- Executes on the given `Model` such that
  it will undo whatever changes were made when `Command#execute(Model)` was
  called.

Below is a class diagram between `Model`, `ModelManager`, `HistoryManager`,
`CommandDeque` and `Command`.

.Class Diagram for `Model`, `ModelManager`, `HistoryManager`, `CommandDeque` and `Command`
image::HistoryManagerClassDiagram.png[]

Undo and redo operations are executed with `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`
These commands store an integer value referencing the number of commands to
undo or redo, represented by `UndoCommand#numberOfTimes` and
`RedoCommand#numberOfTimes`. The Class Diagram below shows details about
`UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand`.

.Class Diagram for `UndoCommand`, `RedoCommand` and `Command`
image::UndoRedoCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Below is a Sequence Diagram of how an `UndoCommand` executes in the program.
`RedoCommand` follows a similar process.

.Sequence Diagram for `UndoCommand`
image::UndoCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how undo/redo mechanism behaves.

==== User Scenario demonstrating undo/redo

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The
`HistoryManager` is initialized. `HistoryManager#executedCommands` and
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands` are empty.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the
address book. A `DeleteAddressCommand` is created and executed in
`LogicManager#execute(String)`. Since `DeleteCommand` is an invertible
command, `HistoryManager` remembers the command, adding it to
`HistoryManager#executedCommands`.

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person.
A `AddAddressCommand` is created and executed in
`LogicManager#execute(String)`. Since `AddAddressCommand` is an invertible
command, `HistoryManager` remembers the command, adding it to
`HistoryManager#executedCommands`.

[NOTE]
If a invertible command execution fails, `HistoryManager` will not remember
it, therefore it will not be stored for undo/redo capabilities.

Step 4. The user now decides that the last two commands entered was a mistake,
and decides to undo those commands by executing the `undo` command by typing
in the command `undo r/2`. An `UndoCommand` is created and executed in
`LogicManager#execute(String)` to undo the latest two commands. The command
will call `Model#rollback()` two times. During each `Model#rollback()` call,
the `Model` will call `HistoryManager` to take the latest command from
`HistoryManager#executedCommands` and call `Command#executeInverse(Model)` on
the `Model`, undoing the changes made to `Model` by the command, before adding
it to `HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands`. After the `undo` command
execution is complete, the `Model` state is reverted to what it was before the
two undone commands were executed.

[NOTE]
`undo`/`redo` commands can undo/redo one or more commands. To undo/redo one
command, entering `undo`/`redo` is equivalent to entering  `undo 1`/`redo 1`.

[NOTE]
If an `undo`/`redo` command is given to undo/redo more commands than
available, the operation will fail and no `undo`/`redo` is applied at all.
This check is enforced by `Model#getAvailableNumberOfExecutedCommands()`,
`Model#getAvailableNumberOfInverselyExecutedCommands()`, `Model#canRollback()`
and `Model#canCommit()`.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. `list` command
is a *non-invertible command*. Therefore, it will not be stored by
`HistoryManager` after its execution.

Step 6. The user decides to redo the last command that was undone by executing
a `redo` command by typing in the command `redo`. A `RedoCommand` is created
and executed in `LogicManager#execute(String)` to redo the latest undo. The
command will call `Model#commit()` once. `Model` will call `HistoryManager`
to take the latest command from `HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands`
and call `Command#execute(Model)` on the `Model`, reapplying the changes that
were made by the command, before adding it to
`HistoryManager#executedCommands`. After the `redo` command execution is
complete, the `Model` has the changes made by the latest the command that was
redone.

Step 7. The user executes `add n/John ...` to add a new person.
A `AddAddressCommand` is created and executed in
`LogicManager#execute(String)`. The `HistoryManager` clears all commands
stored in `HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands`. Similar to `Step 3`,
`HistoryManager` remembers this command.

[NOTE]
Whenever a new invertible command is executed that is not currently in
`HistoryManager`, it will clear all the commands that are stored in
`HistoryManager#inverselyExecutedCommands`. This means that all potential
redo actions are cleared.

=== Course Planner feature

==== Overview
The Course Planner feature allows the user to track what courses they

1. Have taken
2. Are taking, and
3. Want to take

The feature offers updated information on courses offered by NUS, along with
convenient add, delete and check operations on the user's course list.

==== Implementation

The Course Planner feature closely follows the extendable OOP solution
implemented within Jarvis. Within `model`, the `CoursePlanner` class
manages all aspects related to this feature.

The list of courses of the user is stored internally using a `UniqueCourseList`
object, providing an abstraction with `add`, `delete` and `getCourseList`
operations that are called by `CoursePlanner`.

The `String` that is displayed to the user within a the UI text box is
abstracted within a class called `CourseText`. This is a simple class that
abstracts some operations of operations on a `String`, such as setting,
getting, printing to a displayable form, etc.

* `Model#getCoursePlanner()` - Gets the `CoursePlanner` instance
* `Model#lookUpCourse(Course)` - Looks up a course's information
* `Model#addCourse(Course)` - Adds a course to the user's list
* `Model#addCourse(Index, Course)` - Adds a course to the user's list at the
  specified index
* `Model#deleteCourse(Course)` - Deletes the given Course from the user's list
* `Model#hasCourse(Course)` - Checks if the user has this course in their list
* `Model#getUnfilteredCourseList()` - Returns an `ObservableList` containing
  the user's list of courses
* `Model#getCourseText()` - Returns a `CourseText` object
* `Model#setCourseText(String)` - Sets the `String` displayed by the
  `CourseText` object.

.Course Model Class Diagram
image::ModelCoursePlannerClassDiagram.png[]

===== Course Datasets

Course data-sets are taken directly from the {nus-mods-api}[NUSMods API]. These
data-sets are stored using the `.json` file format on NUSMod's API. Since
Jarvis already heavily uses the Jackson JSON API, we have opted to store
all course data within Jarvis in their original form. Therefore, all data
is read directly from `.json` files.

[NOTE]
NUSMods is a popular website officially affiliated with NUS, where
students are able to look up information about courses and plan their
school timetable. This makes its data-set a reliable source of course
information.

Each course, and their data, are given its own file. These files are laid out
in `/modinfo` within `/resources` to be easily accessible by the program.

A sample, valid `AB1234.json` is given below for a fictional course `AB1234`.

[JSON]
----
{
    "courseCode": "AB1234",
    "courseCredit": "4",
    "description": "Course description for AB1234.",
    "faculty": "A Faculty in NUS",
    "fulfillRequirements": [
        "AB2234"
    ],
    "preclusion": "AB1231, AB1232",
    "prereqTree": {
        "and": [
            {
                "or": [
                    "CD1111",
                    "XY2222"
                ]
            },
            "EF3333"
        ]
    },
    "title": "Course AB1234's title"
}
----

The current codebase requires that every course datafile **must** have the
following attributes:

* `courseCode`
* `courseCredit`
* `title`
* `faculty`
* `description`

These attributes are *non-nullable*, this is as from the 11000+ course
datafiles downloaded from NUSMods, all at least have these attributes. The
other three: `fulfillRequirements`, `preclusion` and `prereqTree` are
optional, nullable attributes.

==== And-Or Tree

===== Overview

The `AndOrTree<R>` is a tree data structure served by the `util/andor`
package that provides an abstraction for processing the prerequisite tree.
The prerequisite tree (henceforth referred to as `prereqTree`) is an attribute
of a `Course` that is available in the NUSMod's course data-set, the data
comes in the form of a `String` and will be covered shortly.

===== The `AndOrTree` Class

The following are `public` methods in `AndOrTree`.

* `buildTree(String, Function<String, ? extends R>)`
+
Builds a tree from the given jsonString. `Function` is a mapper
that processes a `String` and returns a value of type `R`, where `R` is the
type of data stored by each node in the tree.

* `fulfills(Collection<R>)`
+
Checks if the given `Collection` of type `R` fulfills the condition
specified by this tree. `AndOrNode` has its own corresponding `fulfill` that
checks its children or data against `Collection`.

Due to the arbitrary ordering of the tree, `insert()` and `delete()`
operations commonly found in implementations of ordered trees are
difficult to implement. Instead, the tree is fully created upon the call to
`buildTree()` and is then enforced to be immutable once built. This is
reflected in the class' lack of mutator methods.

===== The `AndOrNode` Class

Each node in the tree of type `R` is represented by an `AndOrNode<R>`. Every
node can exist as either of these types:

1. `AND`
+
Any subset of elements in a `Collection<R>` must match all children
of this node.

2. `OR`
+
Any element in a `Collection<R>` must match at least one of the
children of this node

3. `DATA`
+
Any element in a  `Collection<R>` must match the data stored in
this node

The following class diagram demonstrates the structure of the `abstract class`
`AndOrNode` class and its sub-classes.

.AndOrNode Inheritance Diagram
image::AndOrNodeInheritanceClassDiagram.png[800, 600]

Using this format, `AndOrNode#createNode(T,String)` is able to construct
all instances of its sub-class, thus the caller will not need to know the
different types of nodes there are.

====== Building of the `AndOrTree`

As mentioned above, we use the `prereqTree` attribute in order to build
the tree. An example of a processable json string is as such:
----
"prereqTree": {
    "and": [
        {
            "or": [
                "CD1111",
                "XY2222"
            ]
        },
        "EF3333"
    ]
}
----

This can be read as:

----
To take AB1234, you require...
|
└ all of
  ├── one of
  |   ├─ "CD1111"
  |   └─ "XY2222"
  └─ "EF3333"
----

This means that to take the fictional course `AB1234`, a user would have to
complete `EF3333`, **and** either `CD1111` or `XY2222`.

The `buildTree()` method takes in the `json` string as an input. The
Jackson API uses this string to create a root `JsonNode` object, and the tree
is built recursively from the root. The sequence diagram of the tree building
process is shown below:

.buildTree() Sequence Diagram
image::AndOrSequenceDiagramSimplified.png[]

The class looks at each node - checks if its is an `Object`, `Array` or
a `String`, and does the appropriate actions and function calls.

Other ways of building the tree can be easily extended by overloading the
`buildTree` method. However, this will not override the immutable properties
of the tree.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storing of Course data-sets

* **Alternative 1**: Storing every course in a single, large JSON file
** **Pros:**
+
Easier to manage. Every course can be found in a single file. The code need
not deal with `FileNotFoundException` or `IOException` as the single file
is guaranteed to exist.

** **Cons:**
+
A large file will be difficult to view for a developer. It will also have
slow performance as the entire file would have to be processed to look up
one course.
+
A developer may also:
+
1. Store the whole file in a buffer for faster lookup, but this may be
   time-consuming and troublesome to implement.
+
2. Process the whole file and create all `Course` objects upon start-up.
   However, due to the large number of course files (11000+), this may have
   significant memory overhead.

* **Current Choice**: Storing each course as its own file
** **Pros:**
+
Fast lookup as the contents of 11000+ files worth of data do not need
to be scanned directly. Fast, `String` concatenation of file paths directly
to the file is used instead.

** **Cons:**
+
Difficult to manage. If we want to modify the data-sets in any way, a script
will have to be written to process every file in the dataset, unless a
developer wants to manually change all files.

We did not go with alternative 1 as once the files were downloaded and
processed, there was no need to modify them any further. Processing, or
loading inside a buffer, of very large text files will likely significantly
hamper performance for little benefit. Manual lookup information about a
specific course during development is also much easier with such a method.

===== Aspect: `AndOrTree` of fixed type vs `AndOrTree<R>` of generic type `R`


* **Alternative 1**: `AndOrTree` dependent on `Course` (or any fixed datatype)
** **Pros:**
+
There is no need to pass any mapper function into the `buildTree()` method as
the class will already know how to map each `String` to a type `R`. This
makes handling exceptions easier as they can be handled directly by the class
instead of by the caller.

** **Cons:**
+
This increases coupling between the tree and the fixed data-type used by
the tree, resulting the correctness of the `AndOrTree` class being dependent
on the fixed data-type, as there will be no way to stub it.
The tree will also only be locked to a specific data-type and is
non-extendable.

* **Current choice**: `AndOrTree` with generics
** **Pros:**
+
This makes the tree reusable in the future. The tree will also be able to
store any data-type which allows for easier unit testing, since it won't be
dependent on the correctness of the fixed data-type (`Course` in this
instance). Instead well-tested libraries such as Java's `String` API can
be used to test the class instead.

** **Cons:**
+
Due to how the tree is built (i.e from a json string), a **mapper function**
must be passed into the `buildTree()` method to process the string in each
node to the generic type of the tree. The function should be of a type
`Function<String, ? extends R>`, for a tree of type `R`.

Due to its benefits far outweighing its disadvantages, we picked out
current choice. While extendability and resusability of the class is a nice
bonus, the decrease in coupling and increase in testability was the deciding
factor in choosing between these two approaches. Furthermore, behavior of
the building of the tree can be easily extended by either inheritance, or
overloading of the `buildTree()` method.

=== Finance Tracker feature

==== Overview
The Finance Tracker feature allows the user to track what purchases they have
made for the month and the list of installments that they have subscribed to.
Such installments would be added to their purchases once a month. The user
can store the information of the description and the amount of both purchases
and installments. Furthermore, the user can set a monthly limit to keep track
of his expenses for the month.

==== Implementation

The Finance Tracker feature closely follows the extendable OOP solution already
implemented within AB3. In the Finance Tracker, the `Installment` objects
(containing `InstallmentDescription` and `InstallmentMoneyPaid` objects) and
the `Purchase` objects (containing `PurchaseDescription` and
`PurchaseMoneySpent` objects) manage most aspects related to this feature.

The finance tracker mechanism is facilitated by `FinanceTrackerModel`.

* `Model#getFinanceTracker()` - Gets the `FinanceTracker` instance

* `Model#getPurchase(index)` - Retrieves the purchase at that index

* `Model#updateFilteredPurchaseList(Predicate)` - Updates the filter of the
  purchase list with the predicate

* `Model#getFilteredPurchaseList()` - Retrieves the list of purchases with
  current predicate applied

* `Model#addPurchase(Purchase)` - Adds a single use payment

* `Model#deletePurchase(index)` - Deletes single use payment at that index

* `Model#getInstallment(index)` - Retrieves the installment at that index

* `Model#updateFilteredInstallmentList(Predicate)` - Updates the filter of the
  installment list with the predicate

* `Model#getFilteredInstallmentList()` - Retrieves the list of installments
  with current predicate applied

* `Model#addInstallment(Installment)` - Adds an installment

* `Model#deleteInstallment(index)` - Deletes installment at that index

* `Model#hasInstallment(Installment)` - Checks for the existence of the same
  installment in the finance tracker

* `Model#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` - Replaces an existing
  installment with a new installment for editing

* `Model#setMonthlyLimit(MonthlyLimit)` - Sets the monthly limit for spending

* `Model#getMonthlyLimit()` - Retrieves the monthly limit if it has been set
  by user

==== Installments

Installments are added by the user to the FinanceTracker and are stored in an
`InstallmentList`. The current codebase requires that all installments
**must** have the following attributes:

* `InstallmentDescription`
* `InstallmentMoneyPaid`

These attributes are *non-nullable**.

==== Purchases

Purchases are added by the user to the FinanceTracker and are stored in a
`PurchaseList`. The current codebase requires that all purchases **must** have
the following attributes:

* `PurchaseDescription`
* `PurchaseMoneySpent`

These attributes are *non-nullable**.

==== Command Execution

For brevity's sake, we will illustrate only 1 specific command and its
execution on model. The following activity diagram illustrates how an
`Installment` is edited when a user types in a `edit-install` command:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The
`FinanceTracker` is initialized. Assume that a valid `Installment` has already
been added to the `InstallmentList` in `FinanceTracker`.

Step 2. The user executes
`edit-install 1 d/student-price Spotify subscription a/7.50`
command to edit both the description and money spent on the existing
Installment in the FinanceTracker. An `EditInstallmentCommandParser` object is
created and its `#parse` method is called. The parse method returns a new
`EditInstallmentCommand` object.

Step 3. The `EditInstallmentCommand` object is executed on the model. The
`EditInstallmentCommand#execute` method is called, and this will create a new
`Installment` object from the existing installment but with all the edited
fields changed. In this method,
`Model#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` method is called.

[NOTE]
The `EditInstallmentCommand#execute` method first checks for whether the
index is within the size of InstallmentList.

Step 4. As mentioned in section 2, the methods in `Model` merely mirrors the
methods in the `FinanceTracker` class. As such, the
`FinanceTracker#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` method is called.
This in turns calls the
`#InstallmentList#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)` method.

Step 5. This `#InstallmentList#setInstallment(Installment, Installment)`
method first finds the `Installment` based on its corresponding index. Then,
it sets the edited installment at the index found earlier.

[NOTE]
TLDR: The calling of the `#setInstallment` method at the `FinanceTracker`
level triggers a cascading series of `#setInstallment` method which culminates
in target installment being edited with the corresponding fields.

==== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: Whether to encapsulate fields for `Installment` and `Purchase` objects.

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Encapsulate fields into separate classes.

** Pros:

Increases OOP to allow better manipulation of objects and makes objects more
extensible.

** Cons:

More code needed.

* *Alternative 2:* Use primitive Java data types for fields in `Installment`
and `Purchase` objects.

** Pros:

Less code needed.

** Cons:

Less extensible as all data contained is primitive.

We ultimately went with alternative #1 as it allowed us to better practice
OOP, providing a clear modular structure for abstracting data types in which
implementation details are hidden. Furthermore, it would make the codebase
easier to maintain. The objects created can also be reused across the
application.

==== Aspect: Whether `ObservableList`s should be used for `InstallmentList`
and `PurchaseList`.

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Implement them as `ObservableList`.

** Pros:

Easier to manipulate for JavaFx.

** Cons:

Potentially complicated nesting when passing arguments to it

* *Alternative 2:* Implement them as normal `List`s e.g. `ArrayList`.

** Pros:

Does not require predicates to be passed in.

** Cons:

Might be more complicated when rendering in Javafx.

We ultimately went with alternative #1 as it provided better support for
rendering when implementing the Ui of JARVIS.

=== Planner Feature

==== Overview

The planner feature in JARVIS enables users to easily organise and manage
their different tasks in school. Users will be able to keep track of tasks
they have done, and tasks they have yet to do.

There are three types of tasks in the planner:

* `Todo`: Tasks with a description only
* `Event`: Tasks with a start and end date
* `Deadline`: Tasks with a due date

Users can `Tag` these tasks to sort them into different categories, as well
as add `Priority` and `Frequency` levels to them.

==== Implementation

The `Planner` contains a `TaskList`, which in turn, contains a number of tasks
a user has. A simple outline of the `Planner` can be seen below.

.Overview of the entire Planner
image::plannermodel.png[align=left]

JARVIS' `Model` extends `PlannerModel` which facilitates all operations
necessary to carry out commands by the user.

* `Model#getPlanner()` -- Returns an instance of a `Planner`.

* `Model#addTask(int zeroBasedIndex, Task task` -- Adds a `Task` to the
  planner at the specified `Index`.

* `Model#addTask(Task t)` -- Adds a `Task` to the `Planner`. Since no `Index`
  is specified, the `Task` is appended to the end of the `TaskList`.

* `Model#deleteTask(Index index)` -- Deletes the `Task` at the specified
  `Index` from the `Planner`.

* `Model#deleteTask(Task t)` -- Deletes the specified `Task` from the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#size()` -- Returns the total number of `Task` objects in the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#hasTask(Task t)` -- Checks if a given `Task` is already in the
  `Planner`.

* `Model#getTasks()` -- Returns the `TaskList` in the `Planner`.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Task Descriptions in a Task
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** As a string attribute in `Task`

** Pros: Intuitive, easy to implement, less code required

** Cons: Provides a lower level of abstraction, especially when `edit-task`
   command is implemented

* **Alternative 2:** Building a separate `TaskDescription` class

** Pros: Higher level of abstraction

** Cons: More code, will take time to replace current methods that deal with
   String `TaskDes` directly


// tag:: ccatracker[]
=== CcaTracker Feature

==== Overview
The application is able to track Ccas. Each user can have multiple Ccas and
each Cca can have multiple equipments needed. In addition, the application is
able to track the progress of each person in their Ccas. Hence, there is a
need to represent the CcaTracker as a list of Ccas on which the application
can perform create, read, update and delete operations on each Cca.

==== Implementation
The `CcaTracker` mechanism is facilitated by `CcaTrackerModel`.

`Model` supports operations to facilitate
cca tracking capabilities by extending the `CcaTrackerModel` which has the
following operations:

* `Model#containsCca(Cca cca)` -- Checks if the `CcaTracker` contains the
  given cca.

* `Model#addCca(Cca cca)` -- Adds a `Cca` to the `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#removeCca(Cca cca)` -- Removes a `Cca` from the `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#updateCca(Cca toBeUpdatedCca, Cca updatedCca)` -- Updates a `Cca` in
  the `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#getCcaTracker()` -- Gets the `CcaTracker` instance.

* `Model#getNumberOfCcas()` -- Returns the number of `Ccas` currently in the
  `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#getCca(Index index)` -- Gets the `Cca` instance by its index in the
  `CcaTracker`.

* `Model#updateFilteredCcaList(Predicate<Cca> predicate)` -- Updates the
  `FilteredCcaList` by passing it a predicate.

* `Model#getFilteredCcaList()` -- Returns an instance of the `FilteredCcaList`

* `Model#addProgress(Cca targetCca, CcaProgressList toAddCcaProgressList)` -
  Adds `CcaProgressList` to the target `Cca`.

* `Model#increaseProgress(Index index)` -- Increases the progress of the `Cca`

CcaTracker has 7 specific commands that support the given operations to mutate
the state of the `Model`. Each command is represented as seperate class:

* `AddCcaCommand` -- Adds a `Cca` to the `CcaTracker`.

* `DeleteCcaCommand` -- Deletes a `Cca` from the `CcaTracker`.

* `EditCcaCommand` -- Edits the selected `Cca` in the `CcaTracker`.

* `FindCcaCommand` -- Finds a `Cca` from the `CcaTracker` based on the
  keywords specified .

* `ListCcaCommand` -- Lists all the `Cca` from the `CcaTracker`.

* `AddProgressCommand` -- Adds a progress tracker to a cca.

* `IncreaseProgressCommand` -- Increments the progress level of a cca.


For brevity's sake, we will illustrate only 1 specific command and its
execution on model. The following activity diagram illustrates how a `Cca`'s
progress is incremented when a user types in a `increase-progress` command:


Given below is an example usage scenario of how increase-progress mechanism
behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CcaTracker`
is initialized. Assume that a `Cca` has already been added to the Cca and that
a progress tracker has already been set for that `Cca`.

Step 2. The user executes `increase-progress 1` command to increment the
progress of the 1st `Cca` in the CcaTracker. A `IncreaseProgressCommandParser`
object is created and its `#parse` method is called. The parse method returns
a new `IncreaseProgressCommand` object.

Step 3. The `IncreaseProgressCommand` object is then executed on model. The
`IncreaseProgressCommand#execute` method is called and in this method, the
`Model#increaseProgress` method is called.

[NOTE]
The `IncreaseProgressCommand#execute` method first checks for whether the
index is within the size of CcaList.

Step 4. As mentioned in section 2, the methods in `Model` merely mirrors the
methods in the `CcaTracker` class. As such, the `CcaTracker#increaseProgress`
method is called. This in turn calls the `CcaList#increaseProgress` method.
This method first finds the `Cca` based on its corresponding index. Then, it
calls the `Cca#increaseProgress` method.

Step 5. This in turn calls the `CcaProgress#increaseProgress` method that
calls `CcaCurrentProgress#increaseProgress` method. At long last, the final
`#increaseProgress` method in the `CcaCurrentProgress` instance is called and
the `currentProgress` counter is incremented by 1.

[NOTE]
TLDR: The calling of the `#increaseProgress` method at the `CcaTracker` level
triggers a cascading series of `#increaseProgress` methods which culminates in
the `currentProgress` variable being incremented by 1.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Whether to have subclasses for each type of cca.

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Instantiate a generic `CcaProgress` for
  each `Cca`.
** Pros: Less code needed.
** Cons: Less extensible as CcaProgress is now limited to a list of strings.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement `CcaProgress` as a parent class. Create classes
  such as SportProgress/PerformingArtsProgress that extend from CcaProgress
  for each type of `Cca`
** Pros: Easier to extend functionality for each type of cca.
** Cons: Does not significantly extend functionality for this version of
   Jarvis.

===== Aspect: Whether to use observable list for `CcaProgressList`

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice):* Implement CcaProgressList as an
  `ObservableList` .
** Pros: Easier to manipulate for JavaFx.
** Cons: Potentially complicated nesting when passing arguments to it as
   CcaProgressList is nested several classes within `Cca`.

* *Alternative 2:* Implement CcaProgressList as a normal `List` e.g.
  `ArrayList`.
** Pros: Does not require predicates to be passed in.
** Cons: Might be more complicated when rendering in Javafx.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class
is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the
  configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`
  which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the
  termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in
  debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file
location, logging level) through the configuration file (default:
`config.json`).
