== Features

=== Command Format

1. Words in `UPPER CASE` are the parameters supplied by the user, while those
in `lower case` are **key-words** used by the program.
+
For example:
+
`add-task t/TASK-TYPE des/TASK-DESCRIPTION`
+
In this case, `TASK-TYPE` and `TASK-DESCRIPTION` are parameters supplied by
the user, and `add-task` is a key-word.

2. Items in square brackets `[]` are optional fields with the command.
+
For example:
+
`add-task t/TASK-TYPE des/TASK-DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]`
+
Can be used
+
With a priority level:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment p/high`
Without a priority level:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment`

3. Parameters with `...` can be used 0, or any number of items
+
For example:
+
`[#TAG]...` is an optional parameter that can be used 0 or any number of times.
+
Without optional parameter:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment`
With optional parameter:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment #cs2103t #urgent`

4. Jarvis can parse parameters to commands in *any order*.

5. Commands that can take different parameters are represented with a pipe `|`,
surrounded by curly braces, e.g `{param1 | param2}`.
+
For example:
+
`export {csv | txt | xlsx} f/FILENAME`
+
As a .csv file:: `export csv f/MyFile`
With a.txt file:: `export txt f/MyFile`

6. Dates `d/DATE` follow the following format: `d/m/yyyy`.
+

Finance Tracker

Feature by
-> Goh Si Ning
////
=== Where did all my money go?
Introducing the **Finance Tracker** feature of Jarvis, which is responsible for keeping track of all your purchases,
monthly subscriptions and debts owed. Upon switching to the Finance tab, you will be able to see a list of purchases on
the left and a list of your monthly subscriptions on the right. The circle in the middle indicates how much you have
spent in relation to the spending limit set and you can see your "monthly expenses" right below that. How neat!

//todo: add a ui ss

As students, we often forget what we have spent on so far, which makes it hard for us to save since we do not know how
much we are spending. But do not worry, as here's what the Finance Tracker can
do for you:

==== Add a single-use purchase: `add-paid`
So you bought another cup of GongCha at UTown? Let's put that in.

This command adds a single purchase (with a description and a price) to the finance tracker.
Don't worry about remembering __when__ you made your purchase, as Jarvis will automatically store it to today's date!
Jarvis will then also update your monthly expenses accordingly.

Format: `add-paid d/PURCHASE-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
add-paid d/GongCha a/2.8
add-paid d/GongCha a/2.89
----


==== Delete a single-use purchase: `delete-paid`
Did you return something you bought on Zalora recently? Welp, I guess that's one less purchase you made this month.

This command tells Jarvis to remove the purchase at the given index on the list of purchases shown on the Finance tab.
Jarvis will also update your monthly expenses accordingly, which also means you have more remaining budget left!

Format: `delete-paid INDEX`

NOTE: `INDEX` corresponds to index shown on the list "What I bought this month..." under the Finance tab. This also
means that the index must exist within this list!


==== Searching for a purchase: `find-purchases`
Ever wondered how many cups of GongCha you bought over the past month? Brace yourself for the truth.

Jarvis can help you search for your purchases that match whatever keyword you give it!

Format: `find-purchases KEYWORD`

===== Example
----
find-purchases GongCha
----


==== Add a monthly subscription: `add-install`
Who can resist the plethora of shows to watch on Netflix? So you decided to jump on the bandwagon and subscribe to it
as well.

Let's tell Jarvis to store this new installment. Don't forget to key in the description and the amount you
have to pay monthly so Jarvis can automatically keep track of this every month from now on!

Format: `add-install d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
add-install n/Netflix a/13.0
add-install n/Spotify a/9.50
----


==== Delete a monthly subscription: `delete-install`
But alas, finals are approaching, and you decided to remove all distractions to help you better study. Unfortunately,
this means deleting your Netflix account.

This command will tell Jarvis to remove the installment at the given index on the list of installments shown on the
Finance tab. Jarvis will also update your monthly expenses accordingly.

Format: `delete-install INDEX`

NOTE: `INDEX` corresponds to index shown on the list "What I spend on monthly..." under the Finance tab. This also
means that the index must exist within this list!


==== Edit an installment: `edit-install`
Spotify just released a new student plan? Great, that means a lower subscription fee every month!

Let's inform Jarvis of the changes using the index of the installment on the list "What I spend on monthly..." under
the Finance tab. You can either change the description or the amount or both.

Format: `edit-install INDEX {d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION | a/AMOUNT}`

===== Example
----
edit-install 1 a/10
edit-install 2 d/Spotify student plan
edit-install 2 d/Spotify student plan a/7.50
----


==== Setting a monthly spending limit: `set-limit`
It's the season to stop spending so much!

Let Jarvis keep track of how much you have limited yourself to spend this month. Simply set the limit to the
Finance Tracker.

Format: `set-limit a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
set-limit a/300
set-limit a/500.90
----

If no monthly limit has been specified, the program will show:

`Oops, there does not seem to be a monthly limit.`

==== Listing finances: `list-finances`
Jarvis will switch you onto the Finance tab if you are not already there. If you have previously searched through your
purchases for something, then Jarvis returns you to the original list of purchases.

Format: `list-finances`


==== Export to File: `export`
A feature coming to you in v2.0!

Want to keep a record of your finances for this month? Simple export your current expenditures to a file, either
as a `.txt`, `.csv` or `xlsx` format.

Format: `export {csv | txt | xlsx} f/FILENAME`

===== Example
----
export csv f/expenditures
----

NOTE: Jarvis will create a file called `expenditures.csv` in the current directory, containing all expenditures.

Undo/Redo

Feature by
-> Marc Fong Yung Kit
////
=== App History

_"Oops! I have entered a command that has entered inaccurate information to the
application, and I am not sure where to find the mistake or how to fix it!"_

It's great that JARVIS remembers your changes and allows you to easily undo your
commands!

_"Wait! What if I am not sure if I want to undo the changes made by the
command?"_

JARVIS also allows you to redo any changes that you have undone! Therefore, you
can confidently undo and redo changes that you have made without worrying about
the inconvenience of remembering and re-entering commands all over again.

[NOTE]
Only commands that make changes to the JARVIS can be undone and redone. Commands that
list items or finds items in JARVIS are not remembered and thus cannot be undone or
redone.

JARVIS remembers the last thousand commands that you have entered into the
application, even after you exit the application!

JARVIS also lets you undo and redo multiple commands in a single undo or redo
command! This means that you can undo and redo up to a thousand commands with
a single undo or redo command.

[NOTE]
JARVIS undo and redo commands in a specific sequence:
 +
 +
Undo commands will undo command(s) starting from the latest command the user entered.
 +
 +
Redo commands will redo command(s) starting from the latest command that was undone.

Let's show you how to undo and redo commands in JARVIS in the following
sections below, which will cover two new commands:

* `undo [NUMBER]`
* `redo [NUMBER]`

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to undo/redo.
 +
 +
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer that is not larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone/redone (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` parameter is not
supplied, then `[NUMBER]` is taken to be the value *1*.

==== undo

===== Format
`undo [NUMBER]`

===== Example

* `undo` -- This command will undo the latest command entered by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `undo 1`
* `undo 5` -- This command will undo the 5 latest commands entered by the user,
starting from the latest command.

==== redo
===== Format
`redo [NUMBER]`

===== Example

* `redo` -- This command will redo the latest command undone by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `redo 1`
* `redo 5` -- This command will redo the 5 latest commands undone by the user,
starting from the latest command that was undone.

[NOTE]
Suppose you have undone a few commands, if you were to enter in new commands,
you will not be able to redo the commands.
