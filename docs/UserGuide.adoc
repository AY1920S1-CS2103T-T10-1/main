on your PC.

Download the latest `Jarvis` https://www.google.com/[here].

== Command Format

1. Words in `UPPER CASE` are the parameters supplied by the user, while those
in `lower case` are *key-words* used by the program.
+
For example:
+
`add t/TASK-TYPE/TASK-DESCRIPTION`
+
In this case, `TASK-TYPE` and `TASK-DESCRIPTION` and `add` is a key-word.

2. Items in square brackets `[]` are optional fields with the command.
+
For example:
+
`add t/TASK-TYPE/TASK-DESCRIPTION [d/DATE]`
+
Can be used
+
With a date:: `t/todo/CS2103T Assignment d/12/03/2019`
Without a date:: `t/todo/CS2103T Assignment`

3. Parameters with `...` can be used 0, or any number of items
+
For example:
+
`[#TAG]...` can are both optional, or used like `#friend #family #food` etc

4. Jarvis can parse the commands in any order.

5. Commands that can take different inputs are represented with a pipe,
surrounded by curly braces, i.e `{|}`.
+
For example:
+
`delete {INDEX | t/TASK-DESCRIPTION}`
+
means you can use the command as `delete 2` or `delete t/Assignment`

Undo/Redo

Feature by
-> Marc Fong Yung Kit
////
== App History

==== undo
Undo action(s) on the application. This will allow users to roll back certain
actions that the user may have accidentally or erroneously done on the
application. Keep in mind that only commands that change the data on the application
are undoable. Commands that just render and display information are not actions
that can be undone.

There is a limit of to the number of undoable actions you can make in the application,
which is set to 20 actions.

Format: `undo [r/NUMBER]`

Examples: +
`undo` (undoes the latest action) +
`undo r/3` (undoes the last three actions) +



==== redo
Redo action(s) on the application. This will allow users to redo certain
actions, or any accidental or erroneous undo actions. Keep in mind that
only commands that can be undone can be redone. Therefore, only commands
that change the data on the application can be redone as they can be undone.
Commands that just render and display information are not actions that can be
undone and hence will not be able to be redone.

The maximum number of available redo actions you can make is 20 due to the limit
of undo actions on the application which is 20.

Take note that if you have undone a certain amount of actions and from that point,
you type in a new command that is not `redo`, the actions available to be redone
will be cleared as of that point, similar to a browser navigation on a single tab.

Format: `redo [r/NUMBER]`

Examples: +
`redo` (redoes the latest undo) +
`redo r/3` (redoes the last three undos) +

= FAQ
