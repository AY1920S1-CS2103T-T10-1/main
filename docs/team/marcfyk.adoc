== About Jarvis

Jarvis was developed by the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu] team.
We are a team based in the http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

My team was tasked with contributing to a Command Line
Interface (CLI) desktop address book application for our
Software Engineering project. We decided morph the
application into a productivity tool for students called
Jarvis.

Jarvis enables students to track their calendar, CCAs,
finances and modules. The application will display all
these information in their respective tabs to allow
students to manage all these aspects of their life in
this single application.

This is a layout of how our application looks like:

.Application Page Layout

In Figure 1, there are three boxes labelled with numbers.
These are the shared GUI sections across all the features:

1. Help Desk -- Unique to each feature's tab, it will
display a list of commands you can use so you do not need
to remember them all!

2. Feature Tabs -- The four main features of Jarvis have
been split into distinct tabs. The tab that you are
currently on would be underlined in red, as seen in
Figure 1.

3. Command Result (top) & Command Entry (bottom) Boxes --
Keying commands into the Command Entry Box will cause the
respective Command Results to show in the Command Result
Box. An invalid command will result in a red border around
the Command Entry Box and an appropriate error message
will be displayed in the Command Result Box.

== My role
My role was to implement the undo and redo feature of
Jarvis and implement storage components to save the
information stored in Jarvis to local storage.
