== About the project
My team was tasked with contributing to a Command Line
Interface (CLI) desktop address book application for our
Software Engineering project. We decided morph the
application into a productivity tool for students called
Jarvis.

Jarvis enables students to track their calendar, CCAs,
finances and modules. The application will display all
these information in their respective tabs to allow
students to manage all these aspects of their life in
this single application.
