==== About the Project
`Jarvis` was developed by a group of 5 students (including myself) from NUS School of Computing (Computer Science) as
part of a module - CS2103T Software Engineering. The module specifications were to morph a basic command line
interface desktop addressbook application into an application that manages any type of data of our choosing. As such,
we decided to create a student life organiser, that manages students' tasks, finances, courses and co-curricular
activities (CCA). Through `Jarvis`, students can better organise the major aspects of their student life.
