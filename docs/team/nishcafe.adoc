=== Anisha Joseph - Project Portfolio for Jarvis

==== About the Project
`Jarvis` was developed by a group of 5 students (including myself) from NUS School of Computing (Computer Science) as
part of a module - CS2103T Software Engineering. The module specifications were to morph a basic command line
interface desktop addressbook application into an application that manages any type of data of our choosing. As such,
we decided to create a student life organiser, that manages students' tasks, finances, courses and co-curricular
activities (CCA). Students can better organise the major aspects of their student life through the
`Task Planner`, `Finance Tracker`, `CCA Tracker` and `Course Planner` features of `Jarvis`.

As seen from the image above, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of `Jarvis` has four tabs, each
dealing a different tool.
