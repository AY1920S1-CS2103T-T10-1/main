Jarvis was developed by {gh_team}[AY1920-CS2103T-T10-1]. We are a team based
in the {nus_comp}[School of Computing, National University of Singapore].

== Project Portfolio for Ryan Tan

=== About the Project

My team of 5 students in a Software Engineering module, including myself, was
tasked with enhancing a program named {nus_ab3}[AddressBook]. AddressBook is
a basic desktop application that features a Command Line Interface (CLI)
style of input - meaning that a mouse need not be used for the application.

We chose to enhance AddressBook into a Student Lifestyle application named
**Jarvis**. Jarvis is meant to be able to manage many aspects of a regular
university student's life - anywhere from finances to university course
planning.

Shown below is the UI of Jarvis, showing my feature:

My role in the development of Jarvis was the Course Planner feature. This
document illustrate the methods I've used to integrate this feature into
Jarvis, along with the challenges I have faced and how I have overcome them,
plus any other contributions I had in the entire project.

=== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of coding, documentation, and other helpful
contributions to this team project. The link to the code I have contributed
can be found at {misc_codecontributed}[this link].

==== Course Planner

The feature I have provided within Jarvis is a **Course Planner** - using this
feature you are able to plan out, look up and check information about any
course currently offered within the National University of Singapore. This is
one of the big features (out of 4) of Jarvis.

Since Jarvis is an integrated system with the focus of a Student Lifestyle
tool targeted towards University students, streamlining course planning
was determined to be a natural feature that this application should provide.

The Course Planner allows an NUS student to keep track of their courses that
they have taken and the courses they are taking, so that they can make
more informed choices on the courses they wish to taken.

The implementation of this feature was not as simple as expected. This is
due to:

1. Implementing a new {misc_tree}[tree] data structure that I had not learnt
before in previous modules. Thus, research had to be done on how to
create this data structure. I eventually had to come up with my own
implementation using the new knowledge gained from my research.

2. Management of the large amount of data from University courses proved
challenging as many approaches could be taken to manage the data. This is
mainly in terms of the data's storage and retrieval while the app was
running.
+
A poor solution could result in program freezes in the order of seconds, which
would be detrimental to the user experience. Eventually, a reasonable solution
to this problem of data storage and retrieval was reached after considering
many avenues, that was relatively neat and had good performance.

===== Credits
* {credit_nusmods}[NUSMods API]
+
Majority of the data used inside the Course Planner was downloaded directly
from NUSMods.

* {credit_jackson}[Jackson JSON API]
+
Processing of `.json` files were handled by the Jackson JSON API.


==== Other Contributions

This sums up my contributes to the project that were not directly related to
my main feature - Course Planner.

* *Developer Guide* {pr_dg1_156}[#156] {pr_dg2_159}[#159] {pr_dg3_169}[#169]
{pr_dg4_177}[#177]
+
I was in charge of the Developer Guide, and hence did most of the formatting,
editing and management of the document.

* *Testability and Code Quality*

** Refactored a `ModelStub` class that was being duplicated throughout the
codebase {pr_modelstub_refactor_131}[#131]
+
`ModelStub` is a stub class used for testing. As we developed our
own features, any updates to `Model` had to be reflected in `ModelStub`. Since
we had five different features, each changing `Model`, we had to edit every
instance of `ModelStub` in the code. Eventually, it got very tiresome and
I removed all static inner-class instances and refactored it into its own
class for easier reuse.

** Added additional compiler flags into our `gradle` build
{pr_modifybuildgradle_108}[#108].
+
This was added as some of us had pushed code that was using deprecated API.
This change allowed the compiler to warn us if we were using deprecated API,
along with any warnings related to Java Generics.

** Refactored `CliSyntax` {pr_refactorclisyntax_110}[#110]
+
`CliSyntax` is a class used to indicate different inputs into a command. So, in
a command with the syntax `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `n/` and `p/` are
considered "CLI Syntax". Our team faced an issue where we had to reuse
some syntax since similar ones thematically fit into our own individual
features. For easier referencing and to avoid clashes, the team lead asked me
to refactor the relevant constants into their own static classes for easy
importing.

* *User Interface*

** Implemented switching using `<TAB>` {pr_tabswitching_b832}[b832] {pr_tabswitching_4d9f}[4d9f]
+
Since Jarvis primarily uses the keyboard, I implemented tab-switching using
the keyboard with the `<TAB>` key, instead of having to either type a command
or use the mouse. I felt that this made the user experience more seamless and
in line with the target audience's (fast typists used to a Command Line
Interface) preferences.

** Implemented Command-Box highlighting
+
The colour scheme we had gone with in Jarvis did not allow us to highlight the
text of wrong commands without it looking unappealing. Thus, I made the UI
show a red highlighted box instead, as shown below:
+
.Command Box Highlighting with Wrong Command
image::ryanytan-CommandBoxHighlight.png[]

** Implemented Styling for User Interface {pr_ui_330}[#330]
+
Along with the help of another team member who worked on the layout, I did
the styling seen in the application - such as the way the tabs look, the
colour scheme of individual components and general look and feel of the UI.

==== Contributions to User Guide

We were put in charge of our own sections of the User Guide content while
another member had styled and verified the cohesiveness of the User Guide as a
whole. Most of the screen-shots were also provided by the team member in
question.

==== Contributions to Developer Guide

As stated above, after the assigning of roles amongst the team, I was put
in charge of the Developer Guide. While each person wrote their own sections,
I was to audit them to ensure that they conformed to the specified format so
as to give the document structure and cohesion.

===== PlantUML

I was initially in charge of drawing diagrams using PlantUML. This was
handed over to another person further along the project. These are some of the
diagrams I drew:
