    "description": "This internship module is open to full-time NUS business school undergraduate students who have completed at least 60MCs and plan to do an approved internship between 10-12 weeks in duration, during the vacation period. The aim of this module is to recognize work experiences in fields that could lead to viable career pathways that are not directly related to the student\u2019s major. It is accessible to students for academic credit even if they had previously completed BI3001 or BI3002. (In contrast to BI3003, BI3001 and BI3002 deal with internships that are related to business).",
