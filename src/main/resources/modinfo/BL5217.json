    "description": "The module will examine how genome-wide datasets can be applied to questions relating to the evolutionary history of animal and plant lineages. Some of the major topics discussed will be \n(1) genome-wide datasets used to entangle rapid radiations, \n(2) genome-wide SNPs deployed to discover patterns of gene flow between neighbouring lineages, \n(3) introgression and admixture across hybrid zones, and many more.",
