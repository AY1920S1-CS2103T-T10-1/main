    "description": "Businesses must manage their affairs subject to a number of external pressures, including government regulation, particularly in the area of environmental and natural\nresources. While businesses cannot escape environmental regulation, they can influence the course of government intervention in their operations, both by weighing in on the goals of public policies and by influencing the mechanism by which governments intervene in markets. To be effective players in government-business relations, how ever, managers need to understand the concepts that underpin environmental policy.",
