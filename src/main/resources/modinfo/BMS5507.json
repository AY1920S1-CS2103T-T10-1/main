Important behavioral economics findings which demonstrate persistent and systematic deviations from the \u201crationality\u201d assumption in economic decision making will be surveyed. Alternative theoretical accounts departing from the standard rational, self-interested maximization models will be introduced. The implications to business practices will also be discussed.",
