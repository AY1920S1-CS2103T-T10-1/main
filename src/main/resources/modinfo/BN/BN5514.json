    "description": "In this module, the students take a prototype through a regulatory pathway in one of the regions such as US, EU, Asia Pacific, ASEAN and China based upon their understanding of the medical device regulatory process. Students will have both team and individual activities and deliverables for this module culminating in a simulated submission to be carried out by student teams. The project module brings together the knowledge acquired from the earlier three modules i.e., BN5511, BN5512 and BN5513, to enables the students to apply the concepts learned.",
