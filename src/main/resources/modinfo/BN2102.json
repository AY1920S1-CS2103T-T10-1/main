    "description": "This course will introduce concepts relevant to the interpretation and statistical analysis of experimental results in the bioengineering field. Theoretical explanations will be followed by hands-on tutorials with relevant computational software. Students will learn how to perform some of the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis) as well\nas to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.",
