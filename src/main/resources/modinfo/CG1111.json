    "description": "This module aims to equip first year engineering students to a computer engineer's way of thinking and will focus on the engineering principles of how computer-aided systems work and fail and the engineering practice of how they are designed, built and valued. Students will be presented a practical computer engineering system, e.g., a sensorassisted autonomous vehicle, a drone, or an engineering event. They are then guided to reconstruct the system via\ninterconnected subsystems through laboratory sessions and group discussions, to explain using engineering principles how the system works and could fail.",
