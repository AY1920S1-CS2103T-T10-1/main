    "description": "This module examines modern Chinese literature and history through the lens of books, newspapers, journals, and other print products from the late 19th century to the present. Interdisciplinary in nature, this module explores both the material aspects (printing, illustrations, book sales etc.) and the symbolic aspects (the contents and ideas) of these works. Students will not only get an understanding of Modern China from an alternative point of view, but also learn to work with these important primary sources.",
