    "description": "Why should we study the downtrodden, the\ndisempowered and the dispossessed in literature?\nSelecting Chinese-language narratives from various\nlocales\u2014especially Singapore and Malaysia\u2014that\nfeature \u201cstrangers, outsiders and nobodies,\u201d this\ncourse examines the portrayal of figures living in the\nsocial margins, and across the fault lines of class,\npolitics, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion and\nlanguage. It also explores the social imaginaries\nencoded in literary texts to reveal the values and\nanxieties of the societies we live in, thus facilitating a\ncollective discussion on the importance of feeling for\nthose we find unfamiliar. No knowledge of Chinese is\nnecessary.",
