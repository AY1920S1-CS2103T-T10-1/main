    "description": "According to conventional wisdom, Chinese women in history were particularly oppressed. It was only\nin the modern period that the patriarchal system started to break down and gender equality was finally\nrealized. Such a simplistic view of dividing Chinese women\u2019s experiences into two mutually exclusive\ncategories of \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d is misleading. This course sets out to provide a more complex\nand nuanced picture of the life of Chinese women over time in China and elsewhere. Topics cover\ninclude marriage, women\u2019s education, works and property rights, ideas about the female body and\nchastity and so on.",
