    "description": "In the eleventh century, a new intellectual movement that we retrospectively called Neo-Confucianism began to take shape and after a few centuries of intense competition with other intellectual trends, it became the orthodoxy of the late imperial system. This module will trace the origins and development of Neo-Confucianism within the political, social and cultural context of the last thousand year of imperial China\u2019s history. It will allow students to see the complexity that accompanied the spread of Neo-Confucianism in history. It is intended for students who are interested in studying Chinese thought from a historical perspective.",
