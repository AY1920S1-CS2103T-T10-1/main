    "description": "How can we approach shared histories among locales of\nChinese literary production? Treating Singapore-Malaysia\nas a nexus to consider its literary relations in\nthe long 20th century with other localities (e.g.,\nmainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong), this course\nintroduces the critical concept of \u201cplace\u201d to account for\nthe shifting attributes and implications of the cultural\nlinkages affecting our perspectives on literary heritage.\nThrough literary texts that address questions of\nsojourn, mobility and migration, it highlights the\nimportance of historicisation when analysing literary\ntransregionalism and shows how geographical distance\ndoes not necessarily co-relate with the strength of\nconnections.",
