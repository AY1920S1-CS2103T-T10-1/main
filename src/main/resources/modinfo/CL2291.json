    "description": "What does \u201cChinese\u201d mean when we talk about \u201cChinese\u201d language, \u201cChinese\u201d culture or \u201cChinese\u201d people? What is \u201cChinese-ness\u201d, and what is the anthropolinguistic evidence for this? The issues and topics covered in this module will help us to address these questions. These include interpersonal communication between \u201cChinese\u201d people themselves (\u201cintracultural communication\u201d); between \u201cChinese\u201d people and other \u201cnon-Chinese\u201d peoples (\u201cintercultural communication\u201d); and, between selected groups of \u201cChinese\u201d people. This module covers a wide range of interesting real-life scenarios involving anthropological, linguistic, psychological and communicative evidence. Students will find practical use for the knowledge acquired in this module.",
