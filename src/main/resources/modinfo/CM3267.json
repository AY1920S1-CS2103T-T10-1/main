    "description": "This module introduces the elements of computational\nthinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the\nenvironment and food science. These elements include\nproblem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition,\ndecomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct\napplication of these elements will occur through\nprogramming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi\ncomputer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make\nreal-time observations of phenomena relevant to the\nenvironment and/or food science.",
