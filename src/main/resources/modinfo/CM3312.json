    "description": "In addition to having an academic science foundation, students with good soft skills and some industrial attachment or internship experiences often stand a better chance when seeking for jobs. This module gives Science students the opportunity to acquire work experience via internships during their undergraduate study.\n\nThe module requires students to compete for position and perform a structured internship in a company/institution for 16-20 weeks during regular semester.\n\nThrough regular meetings with the Academic Advisor (AA) and internship Supervisor, students learn how knowledge acquired in the curriculum can be transferred to perform technical/practical assignments in an actual working environment.",
