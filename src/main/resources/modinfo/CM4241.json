    "description": "Chemical trace analysis is the use of analytical techniques to detect and/or quantify the presence of very low concentrations of substances. This is important in various industries, including for quality assurance, environmental monitoring, food and biomedical/pharmaceutical safety. Students will learn the principles, instrumentation and applications of trace analysis of both inorganic and organic contaminants, including: sample preparation, measurement methodologies, including isotope dilution, chemosensors and biosensors, matrix effects, sampling bias & statistical evaluation. Students will also receive practical training in trace analysis methodology and instrumentation.",
