    "description": "This module will start with general introduction about enzyme, enzymatic transformation, and enzymatic process. It will be followed by various components in the development of an enzymatic process: enzyme classes and enzymatic reactions; enzyme discovery and high-throughput screening and detection methods; enzyme purification, characterisation, structure, function, and selectivity; protein engineering; cell engineering; biotransformation with isolated enzymes and microbial cells; reaction engineering; enzyme in organic solvent, two-liquid phase system, and enzyme stabilisation; cofactor regeneration; and product recovery. Finally, the students will learn process economics and industrial examples on the enzymatic production of fine chemicals.",
