    "description": "Metabolic Engineering aims to improve production of industrially targeted compounds by genetically modifying the cellular metabolism. This module describes essential components of this practice: (1) how the industrial microbes utilize metabolism; (2) how genetic targets can be identified and engineered to improve cellular performance; and (3) how novel metabolic pathways can be synthesized and designed using recombinant DNA\ntechnology, genetic circuits and systems approaches. It also introduces emerging fields of systems and synthetic biology within the metabolic engineering context. Thus, students will learn the concepts, techniques and practical applications in the areas of genetic and metabolic engineering.",
