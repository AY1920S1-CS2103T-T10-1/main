    "description": "The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the field of parallel computing with hands-on parallel programming experience on real parallel machines. The module is divided into four parts: parallel computation models and parallelism, parallel architectures, parallel algorithm design and programming, and new parallel computing models. Topics includes: theory of parallelism and models; shared-memory architectures; distributed-memory architectures; data parallel architectures; interconnection networks, topologies and basic of communication operations; principles of parallel algorithm design; performance\nand scalability of parallel programs, overview of new parallel computing models such as grid, cloud, GPGPU.",
