    "description": "This course will examine some fundamental issues in parallel programming and distributed computing, and the relationships between the two.  Parallel programming: mutual exclusion, semaphores, consistency, wait-free synchronization.  Distributed computing: time, global state, snapshots, message ordering.  Relationships: consensus, fault-tolerance, transactions, self-stabilization.",
