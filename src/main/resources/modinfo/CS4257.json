    "description": "This module covers algorithmic foundations of computation\nand communication privacy. It provides a thorough\nmethodology for analysis of privacy against inference\nattacks using techniques from statistics, probability theory,\nand machine learning. Students will learn how to reason\nquantitatively about privacy, and evaluate it using the\nappropriate metrics. The module will help students to\ndesign privacy-preserving mechanisms for a range of\nsystems from anonymous communication to data analytics.\nAfter this module, students should be able to identify\nprivacy vulnerabilities in a system, design inference\nattacks, and propose effective countermeasures in a\nsystematic manner.",
