    "description": "The aim of this module is to introduce the state-of-the-art architectural advances underlying the current generation of computing systems. A review of pipelined processor design and hierarchical memory design is followed by advanced topics including exploitation of instruction-level parallelism through dynamic instruction scheduling and speculation, exploiting thread-level parallelism through\nmultiprocessors, and optimizations for memory and storage subsystems. Throughout the module, particular emphasis will be placed on cost-performance-power-reliability trade-offs in designing the different architectural components.",
