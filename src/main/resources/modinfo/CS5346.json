    "description": "This module aims to bring together individual pedagogies\nof design, information, and computation, for teaching the\nanalysis and representation of data for visualisation.\nStudents will learn the methodology of developing and\nevaluating an information visualisation solution, common\ninformation visualisation techniques (such as those for\ntopical, spatial, hierarchical, temporal, and relational data),\nand methods for scaling up interactive visualisation with big\ndata. After the module, students should be able to use the\nexisting visualisation tools for building useful, interactive,\ninformation visualisation to facilitate complex data\nanalytics, exploration, understanding, and pattern\ndiscovery.",
