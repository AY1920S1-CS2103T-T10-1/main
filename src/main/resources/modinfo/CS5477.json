    "description": "One of the most important capability for robots such as\nself-driving cars, domestic mobile robots, and drones to\nachieve full autonomy is the ability to perceive the 3D\nenvironment. A camera is an excellent choice as the main\nsensory device for robotic perception because it produces\ninformation-rich images, and is lightweight, low cost and\nrequires little or no maintenance. This module covers the\nmathematical concepts and algorithms that allow us to\nrecover the 3D geometry of the camera motions and the\nstructures in its environment. Topics include projective\ngeometry, camera model, one-/two-/three-/N-View\nreconstructions and stereo, generalized cameras and nonrigid structure-from-motion.",
