Students will be taught to appreciate the need to balance between responsiveness and efficiency in the four major components of the chain: Inventory, Transportation, Facilities, and Information. These four components will be introduced to the students through suitable mathematical and behavioural models. It is recommended that students have some understanding of the Internet and e-business.",
