    "description": "Service design is a process that seeks to understand ways to develop the environments and programs that lead to a high level of service quality. Often times, the success of a business is dependent on the quality of service that is\nprovided to its customers. This is most evident in businesses where there is a blurry line between product and service. When the ultimate product is service, the\nquality of this service is the main element that can predict the success and profitability of the company.",
