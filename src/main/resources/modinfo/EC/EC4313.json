    "description": "This course studies models that depart from the standard Walrasian environment through the introduction of search and matching frictions, with applications to labour, goods, marriage and money markets. By introducing frictions, we can use our models to think more deeply about issues like wage/price dispersion, unemployment compensation, whether sellers should post prices or conduct auctions, or even why money is held.",
