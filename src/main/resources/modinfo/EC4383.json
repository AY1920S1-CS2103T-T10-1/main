    "description": "This module will undertake a rigorous theoretical and empirical study of the economic effects of environmental policies at the local, national, and global\nlevel. It will make use of microeconomic and statistical analysis at the intermediate level, and will incorporate real-world examples. The module will be divided into two parts: first, we will discuss how markets fail to efficiently allocate resources in the presence of pollution, along with the class of policies used to correct those failures. The second part will focus on the empirical techniques used by economists to assign values to environmental commodities.",
