    "description": "This module introduces electrical engineering students to\nwhat engineers do and the engineer's thought process.\nThis is the first of a two-part module: Engineering\nPrinciples and Practice (EPP) I and II. Real engineering\nsystems will be used to show how engineers use different\ndisciplines of engineering, and combine them to make\nthings work. Through grasping engineering fundamentals,\nstudents learn how engineering systems work and fail\n(EPP I). Through learning where systems get energy and\nhow they are controlled, students learn how multidisciplinary\nconcepts are tied together (EPP II). The\nstudents will learn basic design, experimentation and\nevaluation of engineering systems.",
