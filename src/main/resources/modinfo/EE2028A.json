    "description": "This is a first course that introduces programming in C\nlanguage. It exposes fundamental programming\nmethodologies to be followed which involves capturing the\nspecifications provided, designing and scripting a solution,\ncoding and compiling towards solving real-life complex\nproblems. Emphasis will be given on problems in\nElectrical Engineering topics. Topics in the module\ninclude, introduction to C language programming\nconstructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments,\nfunctions, arrays, structures, basic pointer operations\netc.), writing pseudo-codes, problem solving using\nElectrical Engineering applications, program development,\ncoding, testing and debugging facilitating a design\ntowards solving complex problems.",
