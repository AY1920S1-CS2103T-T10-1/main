    "description": "The module will cover topics such as autonomous robotic systems, multiple mobile robotic systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and cyber physical security. Applications to multiple mobile robot path planning, multi-sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance and learning in robotic systems will be discussed. An animated virtual-robot learning platform will be used for gaining hands on experience in designing autonomous robots, terrain building, path planning, obstacle avoidance and robot control. A quadrotor and a motion capture system will be adopted for real-world implementation and experiment.",
