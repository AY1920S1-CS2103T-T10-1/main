    "description": "The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip\nstudents with the fundamentals of statistical pattern\nrecognition (SPR) algorithms and techniques. PR deals\nwith automated classification, identification, and/or\ncharacterisations of signals/data from various sources.\nBecause real world data is noisy and uncertain, we will\nfocus on SPR techniques, with particular emphasis on the\ntheoretical foundations of various techniques. Topics\ncovered include: fundamentals of parameter estimation\n(maximum likelihood, maximum-a-posteriori, posterior\npredictive), supervised learning, generative models, naive\nBayes, discriminative models, logistic regression, nonparametric\ntechniques, Bayesian decision theory.",
