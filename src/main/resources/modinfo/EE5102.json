    "description": "This module covers both classical topics and current techniques in multivariable control system design. It gives students a good understanding of the differences between single loop and multi-loop systems, in terms of both analysis and synthesis. The topics covered include: Principles of single- and multi-loop feedback designs; poles, zeros and stability of multivariable feedback systems; performance and robustness of multivariable feedback systems; control system design using LQR technique, LQG/LTR method, H2 and H-infinity control, and computer aided design software.",
