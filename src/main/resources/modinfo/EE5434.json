    "description": "The aim  of this module  is to  provide  the  crucial  understanding of semiconductor  processes and integration technologies that are extensively used to fabricate modern electronic devices. This module covers important aspects of microelectronic processes and integration. The students will develop in-depth understanding of various unit process and of integrating the unit processes to design a  device  that  meets  electrical  performance  specification.  The  topics  covered  include  oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation Isolation, plasma etching process, thin film deposition, metal interconnects, lithography and pattern transfer technique, gate module technology, shallow junction technology, and CMOS Integration.",
