    "description": "This module aims to introduce students to some essential literary-critical and linguistic concepts in the study of narrative. One of its central themes will be the relationship between system and structure in narrative, and how this can be derived from a similar relationship in linguistics. Students will be analysing the narrative content of written, oral and cinematographic texts during the semester.",
