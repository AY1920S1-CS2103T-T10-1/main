    "description": "The module examines the appeal of s/f as a serious fictional engagement with our consensual sense of reality. It addresses fantasy, speculative fiction, and science fiction as forms of narrative engaged in &quot;world-building&quot; and &quot;word-shaping,&quot; studying such fictional constructs as forms of sociological and anthropological knowledge. It also examines the relation between the &quot;strange&quot; and the &quot;real&quot; in terms of the shared and the antithetical elements that relate s/f to realism.",
