    "description": "This module examines the process of narrative construction and narration in relation to an 'auteur' approach that considers film authorship in terms of a director's 'signature style'.\n\nThrough close analysis of the work of three different directors, we will:\n\n1) explore the relationship between form, ideology and narrative, and the influence of the socio-cultural context on storytelling and meaning making;\n\n2) pursue and evaluate the auteur theory - Who is an author, specifically in film, where teamwork is everything? What makes a director an auteur?  What cultural and/or ideological implications reside in the development, alteration or evolution of an auteur's style?",
