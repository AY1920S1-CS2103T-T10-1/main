    "description": "EN5235 is a focused examination of the various senses of \"political literature\".  One may say \"all literature is ideological\", but this course raises doubts that \"everything is political\" in a significant way. This course examines the differences between \"ideology\" and \"politics\" in relation to literature. The course considers works that challenge conventional distinctions such as that between \"propaganda\" and \"literature\". Students will test definitions of  \"the political\" on a variety of texts.",
