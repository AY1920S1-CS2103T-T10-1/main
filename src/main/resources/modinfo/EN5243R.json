    "description": "The module examines the role of criticism in the crucial period that had seen it evolve into a social institution: the long eighteenth century. It goes beyond tracing the early history of a critic-function to explore its relation to the emerging public sphere of civil society in which the so-called \u2018reading revolution\u2019 had taken place. Selected writings on two key literary figures, Shakespeare and Milton, are examined for the underlying discursive framework granting a critic powers to examine taste and virtue, forge a literary canon, and locate state-culture connections.",
