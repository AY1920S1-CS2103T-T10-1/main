    "description": "This module will train students to read nineteenth and\ntwentieth-century British Literature texts, focusing on\ngothic novels and their treatment of authority, place and\nidentity. Existing scholarship focuses on the fragmentary\nand proto-postmodern qualities of gothic narrative and the\nissue of sites, especially cities and manor houses. This\nmodule builds on such scholarship, connecting these\nperspectives to related themes of property, commodity\nculture, authority/policing, transnational flows, the body as\na nexus of many of these flows, and the implications of\nthese for identity in a modern age. The module will also\nmake connections between these concerns and the larger\nissues of fissures and dislocations in identity and society in\na transnational age.",
