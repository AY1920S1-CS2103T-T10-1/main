    "description": "From Shakespeare\u2019s Shylock to Kafka\u2019s Gregor Samsa, Lu Xun\u2019s Ah-Q and Sinha\u2019s Animal, it could be said that \u201crejects\u201d abound in literature. This module is an inquiry into the affective forces of such literary rejects, such as their ability to generate empathy within both readers and other textual characters, or to elicit from the latter a sense of \u201cpoetic\u201d justice beyond existing juridicial norms, as well as how they complicate the literary \u201cI\u201d or subject. Texts read in the module will include Shakespeare\u2019s Merchant of Venice, Kafka\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis,\u201d Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cThe Real Story of Ah-Q,\u201d and Indra Sinha\u2019s Animal People.",
