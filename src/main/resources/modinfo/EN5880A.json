    "description": "This course examines the shifting perceptions of the natural world found in a variety of English literary works. Through the study of key literary texts, the\nevolution of ideas about nature will be traced from the 17th century\u2019s age of scientific discovery to the 21st century\u2019s idea of environmental crisis. A key\nelement of the model will be the use of ecocritical ideas and concepts as a way to approach and understand connections between literature and the environment.",
