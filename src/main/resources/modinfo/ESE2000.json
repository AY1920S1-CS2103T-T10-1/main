    "description": "This module aims to familiarize students with basic principles in environmental\nchemistry and to provide a foundation for chemical concepts required in later years for Environmental Engineering. Topics covered include Thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, Equilibrium relations;\nChemistry of Solutions; Acids and bases; Solution Chemistry; Organic Chemistry; Electrochemistry\nand redox reactions; Basic Biochemistry; Nuclear reactions. Concepts will be emphasized with\nrespect to environmental sustainability, drawing on applications and examples in environmental\nengineering (e.g. water reclamation, waste to energy, waste to resources, etc)",
