    "description": "The Anthropocene is a proposed new geological era based on the scientific evidence\nthat human impacts on natural environmental processes now rival geological forces in influencing the trajectory of the planetary system. This module provides an insight into contaminant transport and\nnew complex physical interactions between human activities and natural processes. Major topics\ninclude energy fundamentals and need for new energy resources, depletion and contamination of\nnatural resources (including minerals, groundwater, air), transport processes in the multimedia\nenvironment (advection, diffusion, dispersion, interphase mass transfer, reaction kinetics), as well as\nintroduction to man-made climate change and its ecological and societal implications.",
