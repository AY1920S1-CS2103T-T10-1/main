    "description": "This module starts with highlighting the importance of nanomaterials in the context of energetics, electrical transport and thermal behaviour. Later it will deal with different energy systems using nanostructured materials focusing on the energy conversion as well as energy storage. Course closes with various engineering aspects, safety issues and related challenges to be faced in the development of miniaturised energy devices using nanostructured materials.",
