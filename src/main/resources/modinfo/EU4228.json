    "description": "The European Union is often viewed as an economic\n\nsuperpower but a military pygmy. This module aims to\n\nprovide students with tools to evaluate whether the EU, as\n\na non-state actor, can have a coherent and effective\n\nforeign policy. It considers theories and debates\n\nconcerning the institutionalisation of the EU's Common\n\nForeign and Security Policy (CFSP), and includes case\n\nstudies of EU objectives and actions on selected issues\n\n(international trade, ethics, human security), in selected\n\nregions (Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa),\n\nand in relations with international organizations such as the\n\nUN.",
