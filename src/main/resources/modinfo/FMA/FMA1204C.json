    "description": "Face is our socially situated identity that is constantly being negotiated during social interaction \u2013 we can lose face, save face or give face to others. Adroit face management is key to successful communication and interpersonal relationships in our lives. This module seeks to explore ways in which we establish and manage identity through communication. Using practical examples, it will also guide students to develop positive facework skills in a variety of scenarios and settings. It will end with a look at cultural differences in the concept and practice of facework and examine how these in turn contribute to intercultural conflict.",
