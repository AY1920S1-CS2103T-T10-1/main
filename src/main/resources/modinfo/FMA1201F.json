    "description": "Human beings figure war through words, drama and pictures. This module looks at some of those representations from different periods and different cultures. There is a very strong emphasis on student participation, with students being expected to ask for themselves how battle, warriors, enemies and victims are represented, and what attitudes towards war and its possible justification lie behind them. The field is vast, and the selection of texts necessarily limited and distorted by the lecturers' knowledge. Because of this, students must supplement these texts with others of their own.",
