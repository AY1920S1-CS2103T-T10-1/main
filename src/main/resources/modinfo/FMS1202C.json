    "description": "The title of this seminar is \"The Five S's of Molecules\" We live in a molecular\nworld, when many current science subjects seem to gravitate towards\nmolecules. Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular\nGenetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular\nInformatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular\nEcology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz.\n\"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular\nsynthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on\nthe activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical\nsynthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures\ntherefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we\nshall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with\nspecific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science,\nStructure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning\nfocuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work,\nmolecular models, and public presentations. Writing and presentations are\nessential elements in this freshmen seminar. There will also be hands-on\nsessions on molecular models and molecular origami.\n\nSeminar website address (if available):\nhttp://ivle.nus.edu.sg/module/student/?CourseID=99ddda7b-9100-455c-8b59-\n88580af53144&ClickFrom=Outline",
