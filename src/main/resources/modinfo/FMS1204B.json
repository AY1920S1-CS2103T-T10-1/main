    "description": "Computers in our pockets are transforming the way we live; the \ninformation encoded in our DNA promises to transform our futures. New \ntechnologies for DNA sequencing will allow you to purchase the decoding \nof your own genome before you graduate from NUS. While these advances \nseem new and sudden, the histories of computer science and molecular \nbiology have been intertwined for decades. Students reading FMS1204B will \nlearn how the computer revolution is changing every aspect of how biology \nis done, and develop skills to incorporate computer-based analysis into their \nown studies at NUS, regardless of major.",
