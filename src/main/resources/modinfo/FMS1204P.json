[reference: The Elegant Universe by Brian\nGreene, W W Norton & Company (1999)] (ii) Conceptual development of\nquantum theory [Reference: The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene\n(2003) ] (iii) Conceptual development of relativity [Reference : Albert Einstein :\nOpportunity and Perception by C N Yang, International Journal of Modern\nPhysics A (Jan 2006)] (iv) Physical laws and symmetries in physics.
