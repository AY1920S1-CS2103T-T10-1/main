    "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to explore the relationship between fraud and\ndeception and statistics. Very often misleading claims in science and in society\nmore generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but\nstatistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On\nthe other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and\nuncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception\ninvolving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of\nstatistics in uncovering deception in areas such as:\n\n1. Misleading claims in health;\n\n2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls;\n\n3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science;\n\n4. Fraud detection in the financial world;\n\n5. Authorship disputes and detecting plagiarism\n\nIt is intended that students gain an appreciation for basic statistical ideas for\nhandling uncertainty as a key part of good scientific practice and decision\nmaking in society broadly.",
