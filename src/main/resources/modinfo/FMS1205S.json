    "description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce the roles of\nstatistics in science, and how to spot and avoid various\nfallacies that are common in how laymen understand\nuncertainty and the scientific method. It will expose\nmisunderstandings of science, deliberate misinformation\nabout scientific results, and even fraud in science, and\nseek to explain why these arose. The seminar will touch\nupon almost all aspects of life worth thinking about: food,\nmedicine, experimentation, homeopathy, climate change,\nterrorism, cigarettes, eggs with two yolks in them, police\nmergers, ethnic profiling, psychic powers, drugs, human\ncloning, wars, and the little red light that indicates your\ntelevision is on standby mode.",
