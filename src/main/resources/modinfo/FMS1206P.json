    "description": "Increased mechanization has simplified our daily lives\nsignificantly, but their high energy consumption nature has\nalso raised concerns about depleting fossil fuels (currently\nthe main source of energy). Research is being carried out\nworldwide to find alternate sources of energy. Solar and\nwind energy sound most promising but their intermittent\nnature is a major drawback. To counter this, significant\nR&D is being done to devise efficient energy storage\ndevices. This module attempts to give an overview of\nalternate energy systems and highlight the importance of\nenergy storage devices. Principle of operation, R&D and\nfuture trends, merits and limitations of various energy\nstorage systems will be discussed. Pumped storage\ndevices, fuel cells, batteries and their types, super\ncapacitors and hydrogen storage will be focused upon.",
