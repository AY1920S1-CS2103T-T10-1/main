    "description": "In our daily life we are surrounded by images. In science, images play an important role as well. These images contain scientific information, but there is also an element of beauty: we gaze at images of far galaxies or at images of individual atoms. \n\nIn this seminar we will explore various aspect of scientific imaging and address questions such as: What is it that we are actually looking at? How are these images produced? What are the limitations in imaging at small and large  dimensions?",
