    "description": "Biological materials such as hair/feather, muscle, skin, and\nspider silk are mechanically durable and can adapt to\nchanging environmental conditions. Although the different\nmaterials have distinct mechanical properties and\nbiological functions and display specific hierarchical\nstructures, they are constructed mainly from proteins with\nuniversal conserved building blocks. In this seminar series,\nwe will discuss protein structures at four levels and\ninteractions involved in the structures. Students will\nexplore the relationship between the property of a protein\nmaterial and the structure of its constituent protein through\nindependent enquiry, discussion, group projects, and\npresentations.",
