    "description": "In 2011, US White House announced the Materials Genome Initiative to develop an infrastructure to accelerate materials discovery and deployment. Rapid \ndevelopment is now taking place, not only in USA but also in many other countries. Successful implementation of the Materials Genome will impact materials research and development, similar to the Human Genome in medicine. In this module, students will have a chance to understand what the Materials Genome is and its impact, explore related issues such as materials properties, high throughput simulations, organization of information, databases, materials design based on materials informatics, as well as its social impact. Students will be exposed to this new paradigm of materials research and development and become prepared for further study in this new era.",
