    "description": "What can you do with a simple focused laser beam? In this module, we will explore how one can make use of such a simple focused laser beam as a useful and versatile tool in the field of nanoscience and materials research. Students will be introduced to the basic of this simple tool and the fundamental ideas of light-materials interaction. We shall discuss how the focused laser beam can be utilized as tools for (a) Micro Manipulation: Optical Tweezers, (b) Micropatterning and Microstructuring, (c) Micro-Architecturing/Landscaping, (d) Micro-Photocurrent Studies, (e) Micro Photochemical Reaction (f) Micro lightHouse and (g) Micro-Actuating Tool.",
