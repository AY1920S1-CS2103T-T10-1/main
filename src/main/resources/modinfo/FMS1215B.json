    "description": "Plants are the major food source for animals and human.\nThe most common plant pathogens are bacteria, fungi,\nand viruses. Students will form several groups to search\ninformation on the major plant pathogens in human history\nand learn about the factors that influence plant pathogens\nto attack plants. Students will also learn how to recognize\nsymptoms caused by various plant pathogens and\nmethods of plant disease investigation. There will be\ndiscussions on plant disease detection and diagnosis,\nplant pathogen-host interactions and development of\ndisease resistant plants using transgenic techniques.\nStudents will explore the origins of plant pathogens and\ntheir evolution, agricultural crops as food, transgenic crops\nand food safety issues related to plant diseases. This\nfreshmen seminar is suitable for both life science and nonlife\nscience majors.",
