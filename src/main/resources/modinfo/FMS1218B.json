    "description": "We use many different medications every day, e.g. aspirin for headache, Claritin for allergy and Lipitor for cholesterol control. However, people usually do not know the exact protein target and mechanism of action of the medication\nthey take. This module exposes students to the use of computer software to investigate structure of the drug molecule in complex with the protein target to understand its mechanism of action. A better drug molecule can be rationally designed to have reduced side-effect, improved efficacy and bioavailability. Each student will select one drug to explain and present its mechanism of action and design.",
