    "description": "The existence of commercial deposits of oil and gas depends on geological conditions. These include the presence of a source rock, a reservoir rock and a\ngeological structure to migrate, trap and concentrate hydrocarbons. This module focuses on the petroleum system and its significance for understanding the subsurface environments in which hydrocarbon\nresources accumulate. The module provides a useful introduction to geological information used by the upstream petroleum industry in exploration, appraisal\nand production.",
