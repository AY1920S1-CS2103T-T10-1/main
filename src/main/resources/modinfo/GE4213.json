    "description": "This module facilitates a theoretical and methodological engagement with 'the cultural' in Geography and related fields of study. Cultural Analysis examines: theoretical developments in geographical studies of culture, particularly interrelations with domains that have conventionally been considered extra-cultural (such as 'the economic' and 'the political'); and methodological techniques and approaches for studying reconceptualised notions of culture (in particular, 'cultural politics' and 'cultural economy'). The module will appeal to advanced students in Geography and related disciplines interested in interrelationships between culture and space.",
