    "description": "An interdisciplinary study of how societies and different generations responded to the invention of the piano. This module focuses on the social history of the piano throughout the past three centuries, canvassing a wide array of performers, composers, supporters, manufacturers, 'heroes', politicians, teachers and students. Various expressions of ideologies from differing periods eventually revolutionized and efffectuated the versatility of the piano, shaping a legacy which led to the 'globalization' of the piano, including China. Students will learn through lectures, readings, discussions, listening, playing, and attending piano recitals and masterclasses.",
