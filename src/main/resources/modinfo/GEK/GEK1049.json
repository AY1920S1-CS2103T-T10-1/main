    "description": "In this module, students will learn the basic concepts of narrative. It will expose them to narrative as a basic idea that runs through their lives, and which has its most sophisticated manifestations in literature and cinema. While the analysis of literary and cinematic texts will play an important part in the module, students should also develop an awareness of how narrative is used in everyday discourse, and how it shapes their response to reality.",
