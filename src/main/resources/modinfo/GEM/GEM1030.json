    "description": "An interdisciplinary examination of the role artists play in identity discourses from antiquity to the present with emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. The course begins with an introduction to identity theory, and then explores concepts of human, male and female, self, national, racial, and social identities. Common homework assignments - including readings and audio and video files - form the basis of class discussion and written exercises; this is not a lecture-based course.",
