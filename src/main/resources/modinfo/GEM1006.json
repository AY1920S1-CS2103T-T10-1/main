    "description": "This module aims to develop in students an awareness of the aspects of Movement Aesthetics, through practice and theory, understanding that movement (beyond the confines of dance) has become increasingly vital as an autonomous vocabulary in contemporary performance. They will be guided on a discovery of how: thoughts and feeling are expressed through a variety of media, music, art and literary creations; simple objects and everyday activities can evoke emotional responses; any or all of these might be re-expressed through body movement.",
