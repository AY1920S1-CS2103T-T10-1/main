    "description": "This module examines the ethical dimensions of\neveryday life in Singapore. It focuses on moral\ndilemmas that arise in the nation\u2019s pursuit of\n\u2018happiness, prosperity, and progress\u2019. We will explore\nhow moral reasoning from multiple perspectives\napplies to local concerns such as equality, meritocracy,\nmulticulturalism, immigration, and marriage. This will\nchallenge us to identify moral problems created by\nsocial and technological changes, combine ethical\nprinciples with practical constraints, and balance the\ninterests of individuals and communities. We will also\nconsider how moral dialogue can be cultivated in\nSingapore\u2019s multicultural society, so as to manage\ndiverse traditions and divergent values.",
