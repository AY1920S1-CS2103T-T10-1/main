    "description": "We talk and write about the arts on a daily basis, especially in social media, but what makes talking and writing about the arts unique, challenging, and why should it be exciting? This course helps students further develop the basic concepts and expressive language needed to communicate more effectively about different art mediums and forms, and different ways to communicate about the arts, from opinions and evaluations, to formal reviews, to critical and theoretical responses. Students will do multiple oral and written assessments in this course.",
