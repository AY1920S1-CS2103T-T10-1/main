    "description": "Through a series of fun and engaging hands-on activities, this module aims to equip students with the ability to thoughtfully apply computational tools when solving complex real-world problems. In particular, this module aims to impart students with the ability to critically self-evaluate the way they apply these tools, and thus be able to reason effectively in a variety of contexts. They will learn to identify problems and\ndesign solutions, while also developing a critical awareness of the merits and limits of their methods, thereby empowering them to make better-informed decisions and to articulate the reasons for those decisions.",
