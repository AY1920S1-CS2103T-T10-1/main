    "description": "This seminar explores cultural discourses surrounding work, various work cultures, and the cultural phenomenon of a work ethic. Emphasis is placed on texts in circulation over a broad timeframe, ranging from the 19th century to the present. This includes recent popular books on how to succeed in the workplace, blogs and vlogs by prominent figures in social media, novels, sociological and philosophical writing, and more. The goal of the seminar is to adopt a critical stance towards 'work,' in order to better understand contemporary globalization as a cultural phenomenon.",
