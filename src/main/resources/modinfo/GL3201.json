    "description": "This course examines the contributions made by the\nhumanities to the study of globalization. Globalization\nis most often conceived in economic or political\nterms; approaches which often fail to fully understand\ncultural norms, interaction, and exchange, or the\nshifting problems of meaning-making surrounding\nglobalization. To address these issues, this module\nwill take a dual approach. First, students will engage\nwith texts that provide a set of concepts, theories, and\nmethodological approaches distinct to or common in\nhumanities disciplines. Second, students will interpret\ntexts from a range of genres such as films, visual art,\nnovels, television, music, philosophical texts, etc.",
