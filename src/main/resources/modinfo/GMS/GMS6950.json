    "description": "After defining health services and systems research (HSSR), this course will provide the students with a structured review of the topics that have been and are being studied. Strong emphasis will be given on the interdisciplinary nature of HSSR by presenting how multiple disciplines can contribute to improving the financing, organization, quality, access, and cost of the health system. The course will include four major thematic areas of HSSR: i) aging and long-term care, ii) decision science and modelling, iii) health economics, and iv) implementation science and clinical investigation.",
