Senior and junior students will participate in design projects which encourage cross-pollination of thoughts, skills and learning. The students will play the role of a junior designer and work together with the senior students from ID 4105 in the same platform. The objectives are to enable students to explore strategic design innovation through a simulated real studio environment. In this platform, students can select either conceptual or real-life projects led by our industry collaborators and relevant experts within the division.",
