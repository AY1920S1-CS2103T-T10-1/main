    "description": "This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.",
