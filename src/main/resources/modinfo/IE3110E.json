    "description": "This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems\nthat have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modelling techniques, random number generators, discrete\nevent simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art\nsimulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyse and develop simulation models of given\nproblems.",
