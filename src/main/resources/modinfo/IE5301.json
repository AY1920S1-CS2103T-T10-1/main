    "description": "This module will focus on the interaction dynamics between the human operator and the machine/system in a human-machine system. We shall begin by defining the areas of concern in human factors engineering (e.g. the human-machine interface, the displays to be perceived, and the controls to be actuated). We shall discuss also the tools and methodologies used by a human factors engineer. The latter portion of the subject will discuss issues of capabilities and limitations of the human operator.",
