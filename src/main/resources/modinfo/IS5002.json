    "description": "What steps should enterprises take so as to manage and capitalize on them to drive enterprise\ntransformation? Is it possible to continuously transform enterprises with the latest technologies\nwithout wreaking havoc to the business operations? This module first goes through the foundational\nconcepts of digital transformation. Using these concepts, students then extrapolate on existing\ntechnological and business trends and needs for an enterprise (real or fictional), eventually producing\nboth short and long term plans of some duration (say, three to five years) for the enterprise's\nmanagement and utilization of digital systems.",
