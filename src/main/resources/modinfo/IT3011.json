    "description": "This module provides students with a broad understanding\nof the concepts, limitations, and applications of machine\nlearning. Students will be exposed to the fundamental\nconcepts of machine learning, including supervised\nlearning (regression and classification), clustering, and\nmethods such as SVM, neural networks, decision trees,\nand ensemble methods. Pitfalls and limitations such as\noverfitting, data leakage, bias, and ethical issues will be\ncovered. This module also emphasizes on the\napplications of machine learning to problems in different\ndomains (such as medicine, finance, engineering, science,\nbusiness, social science) and is suitable for noncomputing students.",
