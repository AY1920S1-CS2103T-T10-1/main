    "description": "This module introduces students to the complex, dynamic and sometimes controversial world of religious belief and practice in modern Japan. The importance and continual relevance of religion in contemporary Japanese society will be examined with reference to pre-modern developments as well as modern-day cultural, social, and political trends. In addition to learning about Japanese religion, students will be encouraged to critically reflect on such general problems as the definition of religion, religion-state relations, the interpretation of religious experience, the meaning of ritual, and the phenomenon of syncretism.",
