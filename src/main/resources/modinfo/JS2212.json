    "description": "This module deals with modern and contemporary literary works. It aims to develop an awareness not only of the different literary genres and literary theories, but also of the aspirations and frustrations of post-war writers as they struggled to reconcile the Japanese tradition with the Western impact. Both important authors and literary movements will be considered. Writings of contemporary women writers will also be read.",
