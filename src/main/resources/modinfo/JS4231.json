    "description": "Technologies, from lighting to digital installation, play critical roles in theatre performance, while also an integral part of research and pedagogy. This module focuses on the roles of technologies in traditional Japanese theatre from premodern to contemporary times and from pre- to post-performance. We examine the roles of technologies in traditional Japanese theatre within and outside of Japan, and ask how can we make better use of technologies, both hardware and software, in learning more about traditional Japanese theatre. We will also learn to build digital resources on Japanese theatre as a practical way to engage with technologies.",
