    "description": "This module is a continuation of Spanish 3. Students taking this module will build upon what was covered in the first half and continue to expand their command of written and spoken Spanish. Spanish 4 pays close attention to aural/oral practice while strengthening more complex grammar skills (e.g., the subjunctive, passive voice), writing, and reading comprehension.",
