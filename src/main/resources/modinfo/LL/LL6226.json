    "description": "Other than the traditional unimodal contract of carriage, a multimodal contract of carriage requires more than one modality to perform the carriage. Think of a shipment of steel coils, traveling per train from Germany to the Netherlands, then by sea to Singapore where the last stretch to the end receiver is performed by truck.
