    "description": "This module gives a first introduction to various kinds of\n\ngeometries ranging from elementary Euclidean geometry\n\non the plane, inversive geometry on the sphere, as well as\n\nprojective geometry and Non-Euclidean geometry. Topics\n\ncovered include: Conics, Quadric surfaces, Affine\n\ngeometry, Affine transformations, Ceva's theorem,\n\nMenelaus' theorem, Projective geometry, projective\n\ntransformations, homogeneous coordinates, cross-ratio,\n\nPappus' theorem, Desargues' theorem, duality and\n\nprojective conics, Pascal's theorem, Brianchon's theorem,\n\nInversions, coaxal family of circles, Non-Euclidean\n\ngeometry, Mobius transformations, distance and area in\n\nNon-Euclidean geometry.",
