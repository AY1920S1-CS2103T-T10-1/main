    "description": "This module is a continuation of MA2213 Numerical Analysis I. It introduces and\nanalyzes important numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear systems,\ntwo-point boundary value problems, as well as Monte Carlo methods and their\napplications in such fields as quantitative finance and physics. The module aims at\ndeveloping students\u2019 problem-solving skills in emerging applications of modern\nscientific computing, and is intended for mathematics and quantitative finance\nmajors and students from engineering, computer science and physical sciences.\nMajor topics: Iterative methods for systems of linear equations and their\nconvergence analysis, numerical solutions of systems of nonlinear equations,\nmethods for solving two-point boundary value problems, Monte Carlo methods\nand their applications.",
