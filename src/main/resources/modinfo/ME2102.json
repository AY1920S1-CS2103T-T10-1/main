    "description": "This module introduces the students to the various\nstandards and techniques of sketching, prepare\nengineering drawings and specifications, and interpreting\ndrawings. Students also get to use advanced commercial\nCAD software to do 3D solid modeling. Above all, this\nmodule expands the students\u2019 creative talent and enhances\ntheir ability to communicate their ideas in a meaningful\nmanner. Major topics include: Principles of projections;\nIsometric; Orthographic and Isometric sketching; 3D solid\nmodeling; Sectioning and Dimensioning; Drawing\nstandards; Limits, Fits and Geometrical Tolerances.\nThis module also provides the student with the fundamental\nknowledge to do calculations on design components like\nbolts, screws, fasteners, weld joints, springs, gears,\nmaterial selection, fatigue, bearings and shafts.\nThis is a 100% CA core module for all Mechanical\nEngineering students.\nThis module is also open to cross-faculty students.",
