    "description": "This module focuses on analysis, optimal design techniques and fabrication methods of multi-functional structures and devices. The underlying principles of\ncalculus of variations, constrained minimization, and design parameterization and solution methods of topology optimization will be fully studied. Key applications include compliant structures/mechanisms and multi-material soft robots. These devices lie at the interface of principles and procedures of structures and machines. The module will bring out methodologies for designing multi-functional structures/machines and fabrication techniques of 3D printing.",
