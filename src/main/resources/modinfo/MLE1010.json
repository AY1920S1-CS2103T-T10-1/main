    "description": "Students will be introduced to the mechanical and\nelectrical properties of the main classes of materials,\nmetals, polymers, ceramics, composites and\nsemiconductors followed by techniques used to select\nsuitable materials for future design projects. The module\nwill cover the correlation between these fundamental\nmaterials properties and both chemical composition and\nmicrostructure, including the impact of the fabrication\nprocess.",
