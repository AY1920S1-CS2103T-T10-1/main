    "description": "In this module we explore the age-old question of the relationship between ethics and leadership. We begin by examining the theoretical underpinnings of  leadership and ethics. We then move to consider how ethics and leadership are intertwined, especially in work organizations. Organizations are \u201cstrong situations\u201d which exert considerable influence on leaders\u2019 perceptions, interpretations, judgements, decisions and behaviours. We consider how leaders can enhance ethical awareness, make decisions with ethics in mind, organize for ethical behaviour and face ethical challenges at the organizational level.",
