    "description": "An organisation's ability to succeed in international business activities depends, to a great extent, on its ability to develop and effectively manage its international human resources.  Students in this module will consider how improvements in the selection, orientation and training and compensation of employees who are on international assignments can result in improvements in the employees' performance, and an enhancement of the organisation's international capabilities. Besides considering how international assignments - to and from the parent company - can contribute to coordination and organisational learning, students will also consider the opportunities that are available to the host country personnel of foreign MNCs.",
