    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for the BMus Majors in piano, string, brass, wind and percussion. For BMus instrumentalists, this is the first module in a sequence, serving also as the introductory module for access to instrumental studies, both for the Young Artist Programme students and those NUS students deemed through audition to be eligible for access to instrumental study in the Conservatory. The module is also a requirement for those students on the Music & Society or Music, Collaboration & Production Majors, where instrumental performance is a key component of their identity.",
