    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for the BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, wind and percussion. Normally undertaken in the second year of study, this module usually follows as the third in a sequence of eight modules and as the second performance presentation formally assessed for the degree if the student is pursuing an instrumental major. The module may also be taken by those pursuing a second major in the relevant instrument, by Young Artists, and electively by some students on the Music & Society or Music, Collaboration & Production majors.",
