Repertoire selected in this module will build on and complement repertoire studied in MUA2127. As with MUA2127, woodwinds students are expected to demonstrate aptitude in large ensemble playing including: orchestral concepts in sound, intonation, and blend, as well as a professional attitude in working with conductors and colleagues. This module also teaches them essential audition techniques and skills.",
