    "description": "Focused study on an instrument forms the central pillar for\nthe BMus Majors in piano, strings, brass, wind and\npercussion. Normally undertaken in the second year of\nstudy, this module usually follows the completion of\nAdvanced Jury Performance and acts as a preparatory\nperiod for the student\u2019s Junior Recital. Students should be\nfinding a clearer focus in relation to their future artistic and\nprofessional direction, with dimensions of the studies\nundertaken beginning to include evolving capacities in\nself-promotion and production, the exploration of summer\nprogrammes, and critical reflection on their relative\nprogression and trajectory within the specific instrumental\nfield.",
