    "description": "Through self-designed projects, Collaboratory allows students to pursue interests in experimental music realization, collaborative composition, free and structured improvisation, electronic music, or the realization of a student composer work. Students must select a mentor and receive his/her agreement. The project proposal must be approved by both the mentor and the module coordinator by the end of the semester prior to starting the project. Projects should include consistent meetings (weekly or fortnightly), guided by the mentor, and a public presentation of the final musical result.",
