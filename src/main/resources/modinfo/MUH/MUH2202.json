    "description": "What musicians, singers, and composers have, and had, the most, and least, followers, and why? This course is a detailed study of the dynamics among music, music makers, and audiences in history. Central to this course is a critical comparison of historical and present case studies. Historical case studies draw from the western music legacy, and contemporary case studies will draw from the global as well as Singapore and Asia. Students will analyse common patterns, discriminate differences, and make inferences from these case studies.",
