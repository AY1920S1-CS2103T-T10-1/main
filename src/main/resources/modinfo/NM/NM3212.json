    "description": "This module examines how audience research into media influence is carried out. It traces the development of mass media audience and reception theories, in order to explore the critical relationship between mass media products (i.e. TV programmes) and consumers. Students are also introduced to critical analysis of film, television, advertising, video and new media texts, contexts and audiences. In this connection, the module examines a variety of social, cultural and psychological issues as they relate to the media audience, through readings, lecture and practical criticism of discourse and other symbolic acts of the media. For CNM, FASS and SoC students.",
