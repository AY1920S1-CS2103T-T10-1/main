It examines the stakes involved in defining and operating within cultural policy studies by analysing the practices of cultural industries, art institutions, cultural planning and participation, and creative economies. Students will evaluate specific instances of cultural policy development, and produce studies of cultural\npractices in order to re-think perceived notions of identity, representation and power. Students completing the module will appreciate the relationship between critical analysis and policy orientation in cultural studies and be familiar with\nspecific instances of cultural policy development at national and international levels.",
