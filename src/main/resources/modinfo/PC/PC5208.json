    "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the microscopic and phenomenological theories of superconductivity. It lays the analytical foundation for the understanding a wide range of modern applications of both low- and high- temperature superconductors. The lecture links established theories with current research activities in the development of the physics and technology of the superconductors. Students should have a background in quantum mechanics and thermal physics.",
