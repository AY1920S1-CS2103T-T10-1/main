    "description": "This module examines how various traditions, both East and West, perceive the relationship between humans and the natural world. It will compare how, e.g., Christianity, the secular West, Hinduism, Taoism and Confucianism conceive of this relation. Commonalities and differences in the respective approaches will be discussed and \nhighlighted. Environmental issues are now in the forefront of global attention. Our current environmental problems may arguably be said to ultimately trace their roots to (implicit) metaphysical assumptions, to cultural or religious attitudes towards the natural world, to ethical \nperspectives that do not accord moral consideration to non-humans.",
