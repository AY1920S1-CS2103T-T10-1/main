    "description": "Brain lateralization is the notion that each of our cerebral hemispheres (\u201cthe left and the right brain\u201d) has its own unique processing strength. Among the various techniques employed to understand how the left and right brain function, divided visual field (DVF) stands out as a widely\u2010used non\u2010invasive behaviour\u2010based method and thus will constitute a major focus of this module. Students will be exposed to discussions on the historical and theoretical background to, and application of DVF in understanding brain lateralization, either by itself or combined with brain recording/imaging methods. A demonstration of divided visual field method will be conducted.",
