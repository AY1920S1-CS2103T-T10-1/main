    "description": "To address environmental threats, there needs to be a foundation of understanding of how natural capital is systematically being disinvested in while physical and human capital are invested in. Natural resource management needs to prioritize better management of coastlines, coral reefs, forestry, and waterways while zoning, land use management and greening of cities must become higher priorities in urban areas. Specific action areas include urban air pollution, city congestion as well as water pollution, water conservation and water management economy-wide. Case studies from different regions bring out good practices in environmental protection and natural resource management within Southeast Asia.",
