    "description": "To appreciate the implications of climate change, there needs to be a diagnostic of the sources of changing sealevel temperatures, precipitation and climatic phenomena. The implications need to be clearly drawn for climatic changes that are secular versus those that are anthropogenic, for the need for prevention as opposed to only responding. Two sets of actions are called for: climate mitigation involving a switch to a low-carbon economy and climate adaptation involving the building of better defenses and coping capabilities. The needed responses vary across country and locational typologies, and case studies illustrate the types of investments and policies needed.",
