    "description": "An unprecedented level of urbanization is expected worldwide, presenting immense resource challenges as well as opportunities for cities. \n\nIt is critical that the future city leaders learn from urban pioneers and case examples, to gain insights into the urban development challenges of cities, and to make informed decisions based on the principles and practice of dynamic urban governance. \n\nSingapore is an example of a very dense city that is also highly liveable. The module will therefore focus on Singapore, analysed through the lens on the Liveability Framework, and brought to life by experts in various fields of urban development.",
