    "description": "Clean air and water affect human welfare in many direct\nand indirect ways. However, an almost inadvertent\noutcome of societal aspirations and economic progress\nis polluted air and water. This trade-off is faced by every\npolicymaker and this module draws on knowledge from\nenvironmental sciences, epidemiology, public health,\nenvironmental and development economics, public\neconomics, and others fields to characterize this problem\nand study possible policy responses. Given the\ninterdisciplinary nature of this topic, this is also a\ngateway class to more advanced learnings in\nenvironmental economics, cost-benefit analysis, program\nand impact evaluation.",
