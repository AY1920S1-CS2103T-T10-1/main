    "description": "Fragile and failed states pose unique problems to\nthe international community. From the 1990s, wars\nin and among failed states have killed and displaced\nmillions. In an increasingly interconnected world,\ninternal insecurity fundamentally undermines\ninternational security.\nThis module focuses on understanding the main\ndrivers of state fragility and the impact on global\nsecurity. In understanding the root causes and\nconsequences of state fragility, students will work\nthrough appropriate and practical policy responses.\nThe module draws on contemporary case studies of\ncontested states and explores the issues through\nthe lenses of political science, international\nrelations, history, geography, sociology and public\npolicy.",
