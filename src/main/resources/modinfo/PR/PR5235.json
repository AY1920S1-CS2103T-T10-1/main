    "description": "Pharmacy practice has evolved over the years from a product and dispensing-centered activity to patient-centered care. This resultant increase in patient interaction requires morally responsible professionals with skills in solving ethical problems that arise in the course of their professional practice, as well as having the ability to reflect on personal values and behaviours and act upon broader social issues. This module is designed to help students recognize the ethical issues which they may encounter in the course of their practice and to guide them in using ethical principles and theories to formulate resolutions for the problems encountered.",
