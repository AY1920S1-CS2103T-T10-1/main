It takes as its point of\ndeparture the conviction that international relations,\nlike all realms of human conduct, is intelligible in\nquestions of obligation, right, good, and so forth. The\nmodule interrogates prominent ethical languages of\ninternational relations, including moral scepticism,\nsovereignty, war, international law, and human rights.\nIt then considers how these languages arise and\nconflict in a range of contemporary international\nissues. Particular emphasis is placed on excavating the\nground on which ethical choices are made, defended,\nand judged.",
