    "description": "The art of persuasion is central to political activity.\n\nAristotle's treatise on rhetoric, which analysed legal\n\nand political discourse, set the agenda for\n\ndiscussion of the subject until the modern era and\n\nremains supremely relevant to politics today.\n\nPolitical theorists and historians of political thought\n\nhave recently rediscovered the subject of rhetoric\n\nand there is a wide array of fresh writing available\n\nfor students to study. This module will provide\n\ninvaluable insight into the nature of political speech\n\nfor all who opt for it and greatly enhance their\n\nability to dissect the language of politics.",
