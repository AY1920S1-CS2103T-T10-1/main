    "description": "This module introduces students to some of the\n\nmajor themes of comparative political sociology\n\nthrough the lens of a clearly established literature\n\nthat draws from a variety of national and subnational\n\ncase studies. It focuses on the relationship\n\nbetween civil society and the state and on the\n\ninstitutions and processes that mediate that\n\nrelationship. Topics covered include contemporary\n\ntheories of the modern state; political culture and\n\ncivil society; revolutionary and non-revolutionary\n\npolitical regime change; clientelism; and corporatist\n\nand non-corporatist forms of interest group\n\nintermediation.",
