    "description": "Massive social and economic change in recent decades has induced new forms of politics in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Many urban workers lost the\nsecurity of state jobs, while millions of farmers seized opportunities to move to cities for work. Social unrest increased in rural, residential, and industrial settings.\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rose to power with peasant support, now finds support among entrepreneurs. This seminar examines a selection of\nimportant political issues in the PRC today. Potential areas of emphasis include contentious politics, nationalism and ethnic tension, CCP reform, rural development, and corruption.",
