    "description": "In this module, we will discover how environmental\nproblems have exceeded their boundary as an \u201cissue\narea\u201d and have altered contemporary political\ntheorizing. This includes questions related to the roles\nof the state, the borders of the moral community, and\nmatters of justice. We will trace the transformation of\nliberal, republican, conservative, socialist, and feminist\npolitical thought in the wake of environmental politics.\nFinally, we will ask whether there is such a thing as a\ndistinctly \u201cgreen\u201d political theory.",
