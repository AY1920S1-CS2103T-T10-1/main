    "description": "This module investigates the ways in which political\nphilosophers have legitimated, questioned, and\ncritiqued property, markets, money, wage labour, and\nprofit, as well as capitalism as a system. Students will\nbecome familiar with liberal, libertarian, Keynesian,\nPolanyian, and Marxist theories of capitalism and its\ninstitutions. In order to understand our contemporary\npolitical economy and how it came to be, the module\nwill place particular emphasis on philosophies that\njustify capitalism and how capitalism has been linked\nto freedom, equality, justice, and utility.",
