    "description": "This seminar examines the causes and consequences of\n\ntransnational migration, a complex and little\n\nunderstood aspect of globalisation. How have\n\ngovernments and international organizations\n\nresponded to mass population movements? How has\n\ntransnational migration been treated as a political,\n\neconomic, security, and human rights issue? What are\n\nthe gender aspects of migration? We will explore these\n\ntopics through historical and contemporary\n\nperspectives on migrants and refugees. We will\n\nconsider a wide range of sending and receiving\n\ncountries, focusing on states and movements in\n\nSoutheast Asia.",
