    "description": "International society is classically defined as a group of states that are associated in respect of common norms, values, and institutions. This module explores the historical development of international society, from its Christian and European origins to its gradual expansion into a genuinely global political\narrangement. It also explores fundamental institutions, such as war, diplomacy, international law, great powers, and the balance of power. Particular attention will be given to the role of culture in international society (western and non\u2010western), theories of empire, the revolt against the west, and alternatives to a society of states.",
