    "description": "This course will cover density functional theory and its variants for many-particle\nsystems (electrons in atoms, molecules, solids; ultracold atoms in traps and optical\nlattices) from the perspective of theoretical and mathematical physics and will also\ndeal with applications and the intricacies of numerical implementations. A central\ncomponent of the module are the lectures given during the IMS Programme on\nDensity Functionals for Many-Particle Systems (2-27 September 2019).",
