The main aim is to equip students with contextual knowledge of how planning is practiced in contemporary markets, recognising the dynamic nature of the development environment and the socio-political imperatives that drive planning decisions. The topics cover fundamental knowledge on how plans are formulated and translated into development projects, in the context of challenging economic, social and political /institutional environments and focus on professional development using case studies.",
