    "description": "- Application Development Project\nThis is a pre-internship project where the students will work in a team to apply the project management, analysis, design, business communications and programming skills learnt earlier in the course. Based on a User Requirement Statement given to the students, they will go through a complete software development life cycle to develop and deliver the required system. The students will capture requirements through user interviews, produce a feasible design of the system, code, test and implement the solution in a distributed platform. This project provides a simulation of the real-life IT working environment, and tests their strengths in working closely as a project team.",
