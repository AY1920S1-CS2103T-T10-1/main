    "description": "Art and anthropology have had a long, if at times, contentious history of exchanges, from selective appropriations to inventive collaborations. This module explores the vibrant relationship between art and anthropology to think about what each still can learn from the other. We start with a historical examination of the exchanges between two disciplines over the 20th century, from the use of ethnographic tropes by artists to avant-garde influences on anthropological practices of representation. We then turn to the deeper affinities with between the two as found in the ethnographic turn in art, art/anthropology collaborations, and, more recently, the social/participatory/relational turn.",
