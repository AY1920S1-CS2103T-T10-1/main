    "description": "Sports have developed into a pervasive social institution. From living rooms to stadiums, sports extend to a multitude of arenas to influence economies, politics, and cultures as well as the everyday lives of many individuals. This course is designed to provide students the ability to evaluate the relationship between sports and society. Students do not need a background in sociology nor knowledge about the technicalities of sports to benefit from the module. The approach is comparative and interdisciplinary; covering historical and contemporary issues, foreign and local sporting cultures, as well as theories and methods that cut across several academic boundaries.",
