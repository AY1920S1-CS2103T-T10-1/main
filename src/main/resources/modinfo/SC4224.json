    "description": "The term justice is used with many different meanings. Social justice concerns justice as it refers to the societal distribution of scarce goods and necessary burdens. One of the most important aspects of social justice is the way in which societies deal with the collective provision of welfare for their members. Following a brief introduction to influential theories of justice, this course will look at the historical roots of the welfare state and at the central features of various presently existing welfare regimes. Cases will be drawn from Europe, the United States, and East Asia.",
