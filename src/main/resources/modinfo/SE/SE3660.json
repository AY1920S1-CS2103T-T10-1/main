    "description": "This Independent Study Module is specially designed for the Semester-in-SEA programme at the SEASP in order to enable the student to explore an approved topic in Southeast Asian Studies. We seek to develop three skills that could only be most fruitfully realised in a fieldwork context away from the campus environment. These are: the ability to conduct fieldwork; utilising a Southeast Asian language for academic study; and first-hand engagement with research methodological issues. The student is expected to develop more reflexive research capacity and present a seminar at the end of the course.",
