    "description": "The recent strengthening of the U.S. military presence in Southeast Asia is better understood in comparative, historical perspective. This module identifies and compares a number of periods in the past when a powerful imperial force succeeded in dominating parts, if not all, of the region. This module seeks to identify the attributes of imperial domination in Southeast Asia, how it establishes itself and deals with resistance, how it maintains itself through attraction and coercion, and eventually declines. The choice of specific topics will vary in relation to available expertise.",
