The study of maritime culture in Southeast Asia requires integration of data from numerous disciplines including archaeology,\nhistory, economics, engineering, and ecology, to name some of the most significant. Singapore\u2019s prosperity depends to a major extent on its port, yet students do not appreciate its importance. This module will explore commercial and cultural links between the Arabo\u2010Persian region, India, Southeast Asia, and China over the past two millennia.",
