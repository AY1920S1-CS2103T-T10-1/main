    "description": "As Southeast Asian states achieved independence, new pressures reached the region. Between the late 1940s and the early 1980s, Southeast Asia represented an arena of competition between the communist and capitalist worlds. This competition took many forms: diplomatic, political, military, economic, ideological, and cultural. Some Southeast Asians took sides, for reasons ranging from the idealistic to the mercenary.  Some Southeast Asian states became battle-grounds.  For all the region's societies, the political and diplomatic history, journalism and student life, social and intellectual change, and fiction and film of the Cold War era reflected a process of reconciling international and local forces.",
