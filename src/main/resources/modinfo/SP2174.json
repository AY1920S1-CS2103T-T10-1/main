    "description": "This is the second module of an interdisciplinary program\ncovering nature at different scales from \u201cAtoms to\nMolecules\u201d, \u201cThe Cell\u201d, \u201cThe Earth\u201d and \u201cThe Universe\u201d. Using simple bacteria as the model organism, key chemical and physical principles underlying several biological processes which cells can integrate and function as an autonomous machine in order to regenerate (selfreplicate), repair and re-program (differentiate), respond (energy harness and utilization) and re-model (community\nformation) will be explored. These processes will be examined at single molecule, single cell to multi-cellular levels under their general ability to store, decode and\nprocess information (\u201cInformation\u201d), to self-assemble, migrate (\u201cDynamics\u201d) and to harness and utilise energy (\u201cEnergy\u201d).",
