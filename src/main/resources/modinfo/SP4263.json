    "description": "Ever wondered how much of the coffee you consumed is\nsubsequently metabolised? Find out using forensic\ntoxicology! This multi-disciplinary module aims to support\nmedical and legal investigation into the cause of death,\npoisoning and adverse responses to substances. Drawing\nfrom the foundational principles in toxicokinetics, students\nwill be able to (1) study the physicochemical properties of\nsubstances and their effect(s) on the host and (2) consider\nthe toxicological outcomes of exposure due to the unique\nhandling of substances by organ systems. The lectures will\nconclude with real-life applications led by practitioners.",
