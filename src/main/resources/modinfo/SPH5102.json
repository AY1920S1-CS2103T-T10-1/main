Interim and\nsequential analyses, analysis of multiple treatments and\nendpoints, stratification and subgroup analyses, as well as\nmeta-analysis of randomised controlled trials will also be\ndiscussed. Although particular emphasis is given to the\nevaluation of treatment in Phase III clinical trials, early\nphase trials studies will also be covered.",
