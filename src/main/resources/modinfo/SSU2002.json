    "description": "This course explores identity-formation in Asia from topdown\nand bottom-up perspectives, by looking at how\nauthorities, communities and individuals construct their\ncollective identities. The concept of \u2018identity\u2019 is a\ncontentious site as it deals with issues of belonging,\nimagining communities and defining one\u2019s trajectory\n(identity-formation). Looking at historical cases to crosscompare\nexamples among Asian societies, the course\naims to encourage students to investigate groups and their\nrelationships to their surrounding communities (families,\nsocieties and gender) and to examine the relations\nbetween state and identity, and between social activism\nand identity.",
