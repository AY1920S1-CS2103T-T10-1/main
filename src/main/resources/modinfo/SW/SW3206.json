    "description": "This module uses a life course approach to studying gender issues and their implications for social work practice. Three broad phases of the life course are examined: childhood and adolescence, mid-life, and old age. For each phase, the major issues affecting women that have implications for micro-level and macro-level social work practice will be examined. As there are some issues (e.g. role stereotypes) that recur over different phases of life, they will be examined over the life course.",
