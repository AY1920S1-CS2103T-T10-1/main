    "description": "Teaching focuses on the development of professional skills for specific contexts, e.g., in a community development setting, in medical social work, in family service centres, residential\n\nhomes and in the correctional setting. Topics will include specialised knowledge and skills in needs assessments and helping strategies specific to the context the student is placed for practicum. For example, in a hospital setting, topics will include the holistic psycho-social-medical approach to healing\n\nand wellness, healthcare policies and the dynamics of primary healthcare. It is a field practice module consisting of 400 hours of full-time fieldwork where students receive professional social work supervision for the equivalent of 10 weeks from May to August.\n\n\n\nStudents are assessed on their fieldwork performance and a written assignment that relates theory to practice, with appropriate application of literature. The student assignment must be submitted by the designated date.",
