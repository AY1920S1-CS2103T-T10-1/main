Statistical methods for supervised and unsupervised\nlearning will be covered in this module. Topics include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, multivariate analysis, nonparametric \nmethods, associate rules, and cluster analysis. The subject is application oriented  and examples drawn from service processes rather than mathematical development will be used wherever possible to introduce a topic.",
