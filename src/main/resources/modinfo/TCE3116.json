    "description": "This is an introductory module in foundation\nengineering. The topics covered include site\ninvestigation and interpretation of soil reports,\nshallow foundations and deep foundations.\nStudents will learn how to use simple foundations\nto distribute vertical loads from the superstructure\nto the underlying soil formation without\noverstressing the soil (more complex loading\nmodes to be discussed in advanced modules).\nStudents are taught the interpretation of site\ninvestigation report, derivation of relevant design\nsoil properties, selection of sensible foundation\ntype, and verification of capacity and settlement\nrequirements.",
