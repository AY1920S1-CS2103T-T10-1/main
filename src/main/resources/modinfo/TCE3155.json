    "description": "This module covers the fundamentals of structural\nanalysis. Students will learn idealization of\nstructural components, materials, loads and\nsupports, concepts of statical redundancy,\ndeterminacy and stability, energy theorems,\nanalysis of trusses, beams and frames. The second\npart of the module will teach students the methods\nand principles of advanced structural analysis, with\nemphasis on matrix methods of linear structural\nanalysis, influence line analysis and approximate\nlateral load analysis. Students will also familiarize\nthemselves with software for stress and\ndeformation analysis of typical civil engineering\nstructures. The module is compulsory for civil\nengineering undergraduate students without which\nhe will not be qualified to perform his task as\nrespectable civil engineer.",
