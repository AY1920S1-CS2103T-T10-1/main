    "description": "This module incorporates introductory concepts, dynamic modeling, transfer function modules, system identification, control hardware, feedback control and module-based design methods. SIMULINK will be introduced and used to stimulate and examine the effectiveness of various control strategies. This module also incorporates a detailed case study that prepares the students to design control systems for a realistic sized plant. This module is targeted at chemical engineering students who already have a basic knowledge of chemical engineering processes.",
