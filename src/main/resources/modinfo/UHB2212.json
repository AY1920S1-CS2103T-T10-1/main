Are these indeed manifestations of nostalgia? Is any interest in the past nostalgic, or does nostalgia consists of a style or a way of regarding the past? More importantly, how should we understand these nostalgic tendencies? In what senses is nostalgia a \u201csickness,\u201d and can Singaporean practices of nostalgia help us rethink this characterization? (100 words)",
