    "description": "Research has established that we often fall prey to cognitive biases unknowingly, leading to us making suboptimum decisions. This module seeks to examine some of these biases and how they affect our decision making as we re-look at decision making theories. In this module, we seek answers to the question of, \u201cWhat constitutes a good decision and what makes for a good decision maker?\u201d\nWe will also discuss the implications of these biases from the social welfare perspective and explores how we can overcome these biases.",
