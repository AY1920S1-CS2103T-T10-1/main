    "description": "This course aims to provide students with an introduction to irony, a central term in literary and cultural studies. Irony presupposes disjunctions \u2013 between what is said and what is meant, what is perceived and what is real. It thus involves a critical attitude in exploiting and/or perceiving disjunctions. It is often directed with negative effect towards figures and structures  of authority, and is sometimes an integral part of a world-view. Students will engage closely with a variety of texts of\ndifferent types, including poems, tracts, short stories, speeches, plays, sketches, songs and pictures. In doing so, they will reach a better understanding of the roles irony can play not only in literature, but also in society more generally. Since the texts are drawn from different historical times, media and geographical locations, students will get a sense of the widespread use of irony in culture and society.",
