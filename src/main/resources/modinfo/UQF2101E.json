    "description": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of one important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.\n\nIn this particular iteration of the module, we will learn to make appropriate measurements to quantify the ecofootprint arising out of our current personal lifestyle\nchoices, conduct systematic thought/real experiments to explore improvement opportunities, and propose a modelbased sustainable alternative for ourselves, our families or communities such as the USP Residential College.",
