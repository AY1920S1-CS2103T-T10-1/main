    "description": "This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of one important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can\nprovide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.\n\nIn this module, we will learn quantitative tools to understand and to quantify risks encountered in daily life; to compare and to weigh the consequences of these risks\nfor a more insightful decision-making. We will examine the underlying limitations of these tools.",
