    "description": "This module examines the intersections between archival materials, historical memory, and the writing of biography. It takes as a subject an archive in Singapore which has not been extensively used. Students will not only do practical work in terms of archival cataloguing and notation, but they will also study theoretical work on archives and biography, and critically examine biographical work in different media, before producing biographical work of their own. This module fulfils the Singapore Studies requirement.",
