    "description": "This course provides theoretical understanding and empirical knowledge about social movements and their relationship with law and society. How does collective mobilization emerge? We begin with this question and then\nturn to the different approaches of analyzing social movements. We will also consider how states and other movement opponents suppress and control social movements, and how movements respond to repression, and deploy, even spread, their ideas, strategies, and tactics within and across movements, as well as across national borders. In examining these issues, we will use\ncase studies, and discuss the role of law, including how it matters to the social control of social movements, movement strategies, tactics, and decision-making, and movement effects.",
