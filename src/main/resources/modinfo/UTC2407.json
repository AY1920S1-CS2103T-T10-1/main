    "description": "This module introduces students to the concept of \u201cinvisible work\u201d \u2013 tasks that are an integral part of everyday life, yet remain unrecognized and devalued by employers, governments, consumers and even workers themselves. Students will learn about different conceptualizations of paid and unpaid work, gendered and racialized labor, and the challenges posed by a global market that increasingly relies on flexible, short-term contracts. Drawing from the disciplines of sociology, geography, and anthropology, readings will discuss domestic and professional care work, the emotional labour of service work, and the \u201chidden\u201d work of information technology industries and business process outsourcing.",
