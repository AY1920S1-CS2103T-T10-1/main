    "description": "The Independent Study Module provides an opportunity for students who are staying at Tembusu College for a third year to do some independent \ncritical reading or research work. Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study\nprogramme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at Tembusu College must be interdisciplinary, multi\u2010disciplinary, or trans\u2010disciplinary in\ntopic and/or approach. Student and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study,\nevaluation, and other pertinent details. The ISM is a graded module.",
