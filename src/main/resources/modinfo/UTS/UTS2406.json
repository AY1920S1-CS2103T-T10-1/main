    "description": "Are you curious about the visual arts and their role in society? This senior seminar explores visual perception and the social dimensions of art, examining history, cultural values, symbolic meaning, and how these influence ways of seeing in Singapore and beyond. Through interactive activities, guest speakers from the arts world and museum visits, we will find out how some art works changed the world or are highly valued, and why others have gone unnoticed or discarded. Students will explore the socio-economic contexts that create cultural and counter-cultural movements, as well as cross-cultural exchanges in the art world.",
