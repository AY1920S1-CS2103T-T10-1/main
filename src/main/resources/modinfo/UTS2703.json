    "description": "Energy, environment, sustainability and climate change are\nmulti-disciplinary and inter-related elements.With the\nincrease in green consciousness and possible media hype,\nthe quest for single-point, easy, solutions arise. This module\ntakes a systems-thinking perspective to discover the\ncomplex technological interactions behind the\npolitical/socio-economic policies in energy/environment in\nSingapore and the ASEAN region. Explosive economic\ndevelopment regionally, where investment in infrastructure\nprovides rapid \u201cReturns on Investment\u2019, means that there is\ngreater competition for patient or impact capital for longerterm\nsustainable projects. Hence, this module shows that\nwhile technology is a necessary condition for economic\ndevelopment, it remains an insufficient condition.",
