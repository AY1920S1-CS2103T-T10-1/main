    "description": "In this writing course students will read, debate, blog and write about prizes, ranging from the Nobel, to Asia\u2019s Biggest Loser, including students\u2019 personal favourites. Students will consider the role that prizes play in shaping taste, how prizes evolve to respond to different cultural and historical contexts, and what they reflect about modern culture. Students will enter into a debate abut the meaning of prizes by analysing popular and scholarly texts, visiting websites and watching films. In this smallclass, interactive environment, the tutor will support students in honing reading and writing skills, while becoming sensitive to different rhetorical strategies.",
