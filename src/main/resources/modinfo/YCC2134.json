    "description": "This 5 MC course explores basic principles, knowledge, and techniques\nbroadly relevant to science through an integrated approach. A number of\ntracks will be available to choose from, and of these the student will select\ntwo. Although each track may have the flavour of a particular field, it will\nfocus on common foundational themes that cut broadly across Science:\ninformation and entropy; shape and symmetry; recursion and emergence; equilibrium and stability; conservation laws. The course will lead from these\nthemes to solutions of problems that require multidisciplinary approaches.",
