    "description": "The Chinese occupy an interesting position in Southeast Asian history. While their economic contributions are acknowledged, their place in the political and social development of the region is often considered tangential. In this course, we will focus on four themes concerning Chinese migrations: systemic precursors to external migration; the variegated nature of migration; new identities in new lands; and the overseas Chinese connection to China. Through an examination of historical and theoretical works, we seek a deeper understanding of migrations and diaspora formation as we chart out the history of Chinese migrations to Southeast Asia.",
