    "description": "The aim of the course is to cultivate historical, global and comparative\nperspectives on the cultural diversity of science fiction using critical terms of\nliterary analysis. It explores the expansive genre of science fiction, its relation\nto literary utopia, speculative fiction, and fantasy. By beginning with less wellknown\nIndigenous American, Latin American, Russian, Sinophone, and\nSoutheast Asian literary texts and films, before examining more established\nworks by Euro\u2010American authors, this course emphasizes the global reach\nand significance of science fiction.",
