Topics include the relation between theoretical discourse and one\u2019s lived life; philosophy and living well;philosophy as a way of life and \u201creligion\u201d; protreptic arguments for pursuing philosophy; therapeutic arguments; spiritual exercises; and the extent to which this conception of philosophy remains viable today.",
