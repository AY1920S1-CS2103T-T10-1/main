    "description": "This course conducts a deep reading of four major world epics of\nantiquity: Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey; Valmiki\u2019s Ramayana, and Vergil\u2019s\nAeneid. How is epic constructed, and what makes this poetic form an\neffective medium to explore questions of mortality and human\nexistence? What do these four epics have in common as literature, and\nhow do they interact transculturally? We will explore the epics as\naesthetic and cultural artifacts within their own historical contexts, and\nconsider how they transcend their own chronological periods.",
