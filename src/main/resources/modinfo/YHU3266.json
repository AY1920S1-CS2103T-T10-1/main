    "description": "Why is democracy valuable? What does it even mean to call a political order a democracy? How can democracy represent a 'will of the people' if the people disagree with one other? Does democracy conflict other important values and goals? In this course we answer these questions by first establishing a conceptual framework from the history of political thought, and then plunging into contemporary democratic theory. We will use theory to analyse contemporary local and international examples, and be open to real examples posing challenges to theory. \nThe course satisfies these dimensions of the Philosophy major: Skills, Problems; Historical, New.",
