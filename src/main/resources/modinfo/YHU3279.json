    "description": "This course is intended to provide a comparative historically-based introduction to the study of gender relations in Southeast Asia from early times to the present day. It will reflect the contemporary view that a serious consideration of gender history spans the spectrum of gendered bodies. Southeast Asia offers a unique laboratory to examine the changing relationship between men, women and \u201cthird genders\u201d. Examining the evidence in comparison with other world areas will open up new ways of looking at Southeast Asia, indicating where it was similar to other regions and where it seems to have carved its own path.",
