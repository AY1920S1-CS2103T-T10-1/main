    "description": "The course provides an introduction to Asian religions through focusing on the development of Indian religions (Hinduism and Buddhism) in the early medieval period (7th -11th century) when the boundaries around traditions are clearly demarcated. The course then moves on to a parallel time frame with regard to Chinese religions, providing a point of comparison and showing continuities and discontinuities. The course will focus on the main philosophical developments, key texts, practices, and thinkers that will be set within a broader historical perspective.",
