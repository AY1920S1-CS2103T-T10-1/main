    "description": "This course studies women, gender, and sexuality in early America. From\n1500 to 1820, European colonialism and the growth of chattel slavery\ndisrupted customary Native American, European, and African gender roles.\nMajor social, cultural, and economic changes turned America into a space\ncharacterized by religious, ethnic, and racial diversity. As active participants\nor unwilling captives, women from a variety of backgrounds helped to forge\nthese new societies. They disguised themselves as sailors and soldiers,\nresisted enslavement, and fostered new spiritual movements. Some\ntransgressed customary gender roles and challenged sexual norms, while\nothers benefited from emerging systems of inequality.",
