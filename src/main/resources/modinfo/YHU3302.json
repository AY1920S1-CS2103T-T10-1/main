    "description": "This course examines how Latin American writers, from the colonial\nperiod to today, have engaged indigenous identities and epistemologies\nin their work. Anchored by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\u2019s Royal\ncommentaries of the Incas (1609), which in part seeks to reconcile the\nauthor\u2019s dual identity as both Inca and Spanish, we will follow\nsubsequent literary movements\u2014Romanticism, indigenismo,\nantropofagia, and magical realism\u2014as they endeavour to represent in\nform and content the hybrid quality of Latin American reality. All texts\nwill be read in translation, although students with Spanish and/or\nPortuguese proficiency are encouraged to read texts in their original\nlanguages.",
