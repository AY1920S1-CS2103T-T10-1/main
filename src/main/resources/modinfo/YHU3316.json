    "description": "The histories of Singapore and the Japanese Empire collided in 1942, when a Japanese army captured the city and renamed it Syonan, the \u201cLight of the South.\u201d For three-and-a-half years, Syonan served as the \u201cnerve centre\u201d of Japanese-controlled Southeast Asia, and the occupation experience transformed the lives of local residents. The historical record of the occupation is incomplete, however, and to understand it historians must use all the methodological tools at their disposal. This course provides an in-depth study of war and occupation in Singapore, as well as an introduction to the complex task of understanding the recent past.",
