    "description": "This course is designed to give students a familiarity with a fuller range of the more complex grammatical constructions in Latin, and to give them an opportunity to read in a more focused manner specific examples of unadapted ancient Latin texts in the original. The focus of study will be key texts from the late Republican era (c. 70-30 BC): selected portions of a prose speech of the orator and politician Cicero, and select poems of Catullus. As well as gaining a deeper understanding of the syntax and grammar of Latin \u2013\nand a greater awareness that language is resistant to static \u2018rules\u2019 \u2013 students\nwill develop an increased cultural knowledge in Roman late Republican\nsociety and literary production.",
