    "description": "Examining regional and transnational oceanic frameworks, including\nMediterranean Studies, Transpacific Studies, Transatlantic Studies\n(including the Black Atlantic) and Indian Ocean Studies, this course asks\nwhat these transoceanic perspectives offer students of literature and the\narts. Oceanic frameworks allow for interdisciplinary work, and can be\ncombined with feminist, queer, eco-critical, digital humanities and\npostcolonial approaches. We will also be exploring the idea of hydropoetics,\nthe creative practice of writing about/on water, and thinking\nabout the ocean as an artistic, cultural and creative space. Incorporating\ntheoretical and fictional texts, this course offers students the opportunity\nto produce a creative final project.",
