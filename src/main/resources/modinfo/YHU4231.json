    "description": "This 4000 level module introduces students to one of the most discussed\nfields of ancient history. New work on the ancient economy has called into\nquestion the communis opinio on the social structure of pre-modern\nsocieties, and is key to an emerging consensus on the very high degree of\neconomic, social, and political complexity of the Ancient World. Using a\nvast range of diverse and fragmented sources, the course will further\nintroduce students to all key epistemological issues of ancient history.",
