    "description": "This module aims to study creativity in all the circumstances where art and poetry confront violence as a fact of life, whether in the form of violence to oneself or others, or to the environment or to institutions and values. The module draws examples from the history of art and poetry to address a single question: what can art and poetry do about the utter negativity that is violence? The module will aim to study the nature of violence on the scale of the individual and the group, and as having implications for gender, race, sexuality, politics, ideology, and ethics.",
