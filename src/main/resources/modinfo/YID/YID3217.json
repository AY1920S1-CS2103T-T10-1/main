    "description": "An investigation of systems thinking, modelling, and simulation. The module pairs a theoretical foundation in systems thinking with applied training in techniques of non-linear modelling and systems simulation. Questions covered by the module include: What are the benefits of systems thinking, modelling, and simulation? What are systems models and how are they developed? How is systems knowledge usefully applied to real-world problems?",
