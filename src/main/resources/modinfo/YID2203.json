    "description": "Ecology investigates the complex interactions between organisms and their\nenvironment, including other organisms. This course asks how life\u2010history\nstrategies, environmental conditions, and local biotic interactions (e.g.\ncompetition, trophic interactions) shape the structure and dynamics of\nnatural communities (e.g. functional composition, diversity, productivity,\nstability, and food webs). It also explores how natural communities form metacommunities over larger spatial scales and across ecosystems\nboundaries. Students draw on selected case studies to examine (1) links\nbetween biodiversity and ecosystem productivity, stability, and resilience;\nand (2) management options for biodiversity and ecosystem services in\nhuman\u2010dominated landscapes.",
