    "description": "This seminar focuses on changes in agriculture and environment now underway in rural areas around the world. Students are introduced to work of scholars, practitioners and activists focusing on the deepening links among rural poverty, food insecurity, social injustice, environmental degradation, and climate change. Drawing on cases from Asia, Africa, and the Americas, we explore the social, political, economic, cultural and material processes that drive change in agrarian societies and environments. Topics include the\nGreen Revolution and its legacies, neoliberalization of agriculture, land grabbing in the 21st century, peasant movements and resistance, and the rise of \u201calternative\u201d agri-food systems.",
