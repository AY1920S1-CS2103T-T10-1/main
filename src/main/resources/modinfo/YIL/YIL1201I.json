    "description": "Beginning Italian 1 is designed to help students develop a basic ability to read, write, understand, and speak Italian as well as to expand their cultural competency. Since all linguistic skills cannot be fully developed in one semester alone, stress will be placed on the acquisition of basic structures, which will be developed and reinforced in subsequent modules. The course will be conducted in Italian via teleconference from Yale.",
