    "description": "This course is designed to help students develop critical reading and writing skills through the use of contemporary Chinese cinema and film-related literary works. Students will also have the opportunity to compare and contrast Chinese films with the literature from which they are adapted. These activities, which include speaking, listening, writing, and reading, will provide a rich experience that goes beyond traditional language learning. Class instruction and discussion, conducted only in Chinese, will challenge students to form their own opinions of characters and themes, with less of a focus on grammar.",
