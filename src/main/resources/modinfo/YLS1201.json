    "description": "Beginning Spanish 1 is the introductory module to the language and culture of the Hispanic world. This course is designed to help you develop a basic ability to read, write, understand, and speak Spanish as well as to expand students' cultural competency. Since all linguistic skills cannot be fully developed in Beginning Spanish 1 alone, stress will be placed on the acquisition of basic structures, which will be developed and reinforced in subsequent modules.",
