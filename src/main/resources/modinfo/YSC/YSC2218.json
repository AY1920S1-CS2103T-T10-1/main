    "description": "Module will feature a survey of selected experiments and facilities related to research in high energy particle physics, both presently in operation (e.g., Large Hadron Collider, CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, Aegis, IceCube) and planned (e.g., LBNF, LZ). Following introductory lectures and problem sets, students will each be assigned 2 experiments about which they will make 20-30 min presentations on separate occasions.",
