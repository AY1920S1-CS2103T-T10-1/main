    "description": "For more than a century, scientists have used model organisms to address\nquestions in biology. An explosion of recent research has given us the tools\nto use dogs and other canids as model organisms. In this course we study the\ngenetics and genomics, evolution, ecology, and behaviour of dogs, and use\ndogs as a \u201cstepping\u2010off\u201d point to examine other topics in the life sciences. As a class we will formulate and address hypotheses using a variety of\nlaboratory and field techniques.",
