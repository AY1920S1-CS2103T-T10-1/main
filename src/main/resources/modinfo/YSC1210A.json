    "description": "Modern Physics aims to introduce students to the main ideas of physics that has driven its progress in the last century. The topics covered may differ from year to year, depending on the instructor, but can include some aspects of quantum mechanics, special relativity, condensed matter and solid-state physics, particle physics, and cosmology.\n\nThe course targets students with a strong interest in physics. The content will\nbe pitched at an introductory level, focused on conceptual understanding,\nwithout the formal mathematical rigor typical of a higher-level Physical\nScience major course on similar topics.",
