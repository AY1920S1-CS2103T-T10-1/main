    "description": "This introductory physics course uses the platform of hands-on\nelectronics to introduce students to concepts in electro-magnetism\nincluding electrostatics and electrodynamics. Using electronic\ncomponents to build linear and non-linear oscillators, students will be\nintroduced to concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The\ncourse is intended for both science majors and also non-majors.",
