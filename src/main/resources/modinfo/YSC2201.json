    "description": "This course provides a major course for mathematics majors, and a first pure mathematics course open to all liberal arts students.  Number theory is uniquely suited to this dual purpose since it requires no mathematics background beyond the level of secondary school.  Many institutions have \u201cmath for liberal arts\u201d courses, and number theory can serve this purpose along with training potential majors in mathematics.",
