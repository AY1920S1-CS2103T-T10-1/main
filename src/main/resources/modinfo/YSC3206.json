    "description": "This course embarks on a deep study of the real numbers and functions of a\nsingle real variable. Fundamental properties of real numbers \u2013 arithmetic,\ndistance, limit, convergence, order \u2013 are developed from scratch. From\nthere, the course delves into the inner workings of calculus, the general\nnotions of continuity, differentiability, measure, and integration, for\nfunctions of one real variable.",
