    "description": "This is a first course in the quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules, their\nchemical bonds and their interaction with radiation. It will cover the basic\nelements and techniques in quantum mechanics, the electronic structure of\natoms and molecules and chemical bonds, spectroscopy and quantum\ntransitions in atoms and molecules.\n\nWithin the Physical Sciences major, it will count toward pathways in\nchemistry, materials science, nanoscience, chemical physics, or related fields.",
