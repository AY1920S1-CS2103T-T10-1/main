    "description": "This course focuses on the extension of calculus to smooth functions of many\nvariables. A geometric approach leads to a treatment of regions in n-dimensional space, smooth functions and their derivatives, differential\nforms, cycles, and integration. This course may be suitable for students\nseeking advanced study in mathematics for physics or economics.",
