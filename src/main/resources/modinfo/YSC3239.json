    "description": "This course explores the role of geometry in the emergence of\nperspective drawing during the Italian Renaissance. Through in-depth\ncomparisons of seminal treatises such as Euclid\u2019s Elements and Leon\nBattista Alberti\u2019s On Painting, students will rediscover the crucial ideas\nthat motivated the development of (non-Euclidean) projective geometry\nin seventeenth century Europe. No prior knowledge of geometry or\nfamiliarity with advanced mathematics is required.",
