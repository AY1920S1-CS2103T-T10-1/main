    "description": "The Maths, Computational & Statistical Science (MCS) Capstone Project is a year-long 10-MC module, straddling two semesters that students in the MCS major must complete in order to graduate. It allows students the opportunity to pursue, in depth, an advanced project of their own choosing, under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. The Capstone is intended to: \n\u2022 give students the opportunity to work independently;\n\u2022 encourage students to develop and exhibit aspects of their ability that may not be revealed by course work or a written examination;\n\u2022 foster skills and attributes that will be of continuing usefulness in their later career.",
