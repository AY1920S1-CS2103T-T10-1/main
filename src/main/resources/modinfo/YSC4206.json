    "description": "Harmonic Analysis is a classical field of mathematics with roots in\nsolving partial differential equations and also playing a major role in\nquantum physics. \u201cBig Data\u201d has made applied harmonic analysis a\nmajor field of current mathematical research. Applications range from\nmedical to astronomical imaging, from X-ray crystallography to data compression or machine learning. This module is an introduction to\nbasic techniques of harmonic analysis (convolution, approximation,\nFourier analysis) and applications in physics or data science (frames\nwavelets, sparsity). The choice of topics will depend on the instructor.",
