    "description": "Partial differential equations are used to provide quantitative, predictive models for the universe. We study the essential equations of classical mathematical physics, including the heat and wave equations.\nStudents will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including separation of variables, and Fourier series and integral transforms.",
