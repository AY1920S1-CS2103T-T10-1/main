    "description": "Much of modern science and mathematics is expressed in the language of differential equations. Population models in ecology, financial growth, heat conduction, and water waves are a few examples. In this course, you will solve the classical linear ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nStudents will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including integrating factors, separation of variables, and Fourier series.",
