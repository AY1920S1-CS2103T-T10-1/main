    "description": "This course offers an introduction to the field of Digital Humanities, broadly considered. We will begin with an overview of the field, discussing different ways to collect, transform, visualize, and analyze humanities data, such as plays or novels. The remaining days will consist of deep dives into specific areas of Digital Humanities research, including text mining, network analysis, and mapping. Throughout, we will move between aggregate, distant readings of texts and traditional close readings to consider what\u2019s gained and lost in the transition.",
