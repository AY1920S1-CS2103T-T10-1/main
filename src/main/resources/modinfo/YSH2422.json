    "description": "Homosexuality has recently become a flashpoint in local and global cultural\nconflicts, from debates over 377a in Singapore and 377 in India to debates\nacross the globe over gay marriage; homosexuality, modernity, and\nnational identity; and the related issue of trans* rights. This course\nprovides an introduction to the historical context for those debates by\nexploring the legacy of the colonial regulation of (homo)sexuality and the\nrise and global circulation of both gay and antigay politics. It also surveys\nsome of the patterns in how those debates have developed locally in\nrecent decades.",
