    "description": "An introduction to the mathematical study of human language. The\ncourse presents the tools that form the foundation of theoretical\napproaches to linguistic structure. Topics will include set theory,\nalgebraic structures, formal language and automata theory. Throughout\nthe course, students will be actively engaged in problem solving, with\nemphasis on the role the mathematical tools under study have in\nrevealing and explaining patterns in the syntax (sentence structure) and\nsemantics (sentence meaning) of natural language.",
