    "description": "Languages are at the same time very different from one another and yet\nalso very similar. How is that possible? To answer this question, we need to\nthink of language not only as a set of words and their associated sounds,\nbut also as a more abstract object: a set of mental principles that govern\nhow we put together the various components of a complex grammatical\nsystem. This course explores the general principles that underlie how we\ncombine words to form sentences, focusing on similarities and differences\nacross languages.",
