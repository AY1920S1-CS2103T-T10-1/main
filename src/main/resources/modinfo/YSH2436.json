    "description": "What to listen for in fugues using Bach\u2019s collection as an omnibus guide.\nStudents are introduced to structural listening as the primary mode of\nengaging content in this music. Bach\u2019s fugues demonstrate a wide range of\nexpressions and techniques that are found in the works of many other\ncomposers, so analytical techniques learned in the seminar can be applied\ngenerally. No composition work required. Ability to read music in treble\nand bass clefs assumed, with further knowledge of keys, scales, and meters\nprerequisite. No prior work in harmony or counterpoint is necessary.",
