    "description": "The connections between punishment, power and justice are abundant and complex. In the acts of surveillance, confiscation, incarceration, reformation and execution that constitute penality, the state claims the right and obligation to commit acts of violence and transgression that are otherwise forbidden. In this course, we will study the social institution of punishment from an historical, theoretical and comparative perspective, focusing on issues of culture, inequality, security, and everyday life.",
