    "description": "This course offers students an introduction to the central themes and debates in Ancient Greek Political Philosophy through a careful reading of Plato\u2019s Republic and Aristotle\u2019s Politics. Questions and themes include: How should I/we live? What is justice, freedom, and equality? What are the virtues of citizens and rulers? What is the relationship between the individual and the state? How should we envision the relationship between morality and politics? While understanding the works of Plato and Aristotle within their historical context, we will also be interested in understanding how they can help us to think about politics in contemporary societies.",
