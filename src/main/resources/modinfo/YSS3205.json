    "description": "In this course, we will study the theoretical and empirical foundations and\npolicies of international trade at a fairly abstract and rigorous level. The\ncourse materials and lectures will employ mathematics. The issues that will\nbe addressed include the causes of international trade, the gains from trade,\nthe role of international capital movements, the effects of trade and\ninvestment barriers, etc. We will also read about real\u2010world areas of trade, such as trade institutions, the interactions between trade and development\nissues, etc. We will study models in trade and apply them to questions of\ninterest in the real world.",
