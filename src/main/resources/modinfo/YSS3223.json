    "description": "In highly problematic ways Asian Medical Systems are colonial, Orientalist\nconstructs that have been heavily influenced by nationalism and the\nmodernity of religion. It is common to speak of Ayurveda (\u201cIndian\u201d\nmedicine), Unani (Greek/Arabic/\u201dIslamic\u201d medicine), Traditional Chinese\nMedicine and Tibetan Buddhist Medicine as though these are timeless, authentic, self\u2010contained traditions. Drawing on a range of contemporary\ntheoretical insights in anthropology and history this course examines the way\nin which forms of \u201cmedical\u201d knowledge and embodied practice in Asia are\nshaped by the cultural dynamics of pre\u2010colonial, colonial and post\u2010colonial\nglobalization.",
