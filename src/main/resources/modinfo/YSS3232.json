    "description": "Perhaps the most central and original function of the state is to protect us\nfrom each other and mediate our disputes. The very legitimacy of the state \u2013\nwhether democratic or autocratic \u2010 is, in part, dependent on the successful\nexecution of this function. This is perhaps because of the enormous personal,\nsocial, and economic costs of crime. Yet many approaches to crime are\nirrational, wasteful, and harmful to victims, society, and perpetrators alike.\n\nThis course provides a culturally comparative and multidisciplinary overview\nof foundational questions related to the nature and prevention of crime, and\nhow states ought best to respond.",
