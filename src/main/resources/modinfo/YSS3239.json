    "description": "This course explores the phenomenon of peri\u2010urbanization\u2014rapid sociospatial\ntransformation occurring at the edges of cities and between urban\nand rural. We will investigate this phenomenon through the eyes of people\nwho inhabit these areas, examining their experiences of precariousness and\nhybridity. Most importantly, we will explore the exclusion, marginalization,\nand inequity that is particularly prominent in peri\u2010urban areas. In doing so, we will also critically examine the definition of urban and rural. The course is\nglobal in scope, including suburbs in the US, urban regions in Europe, slums\nin Latin America and the Middle East, and villages in Asia.",
