    "description": "This course explores the relationship between youths and their urban environments from a global perspective. More than half of the world\u2019s young people live in cities today, where they contribute to urban life from everyday use of street space to participation in politics and transnational mobility. Yet, structures of inequality continue to frame their lives. Through the lens of youth urbanism, students examine theories, debates, and policy concerns across social inequalities, education/employment, migration, citizenship, and politics - themes relevant to the fields of Urban Studies and Global Affairs. Critical evaluation, writing, and project-work skills will also be developed through assignments.",
