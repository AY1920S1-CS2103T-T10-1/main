    "description": "The rise of China is creating unprecedented global challenges and opportunities. This course helps students achieve a nuanced cultural understanding of this potential superpower by critically examining the concepts of \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cChineseness\u201d from an anthropological perspective. Topics include ethnic relations, imperialism, and the civilized-barbarian distinction; gender, patriarchy, and the family; popular religion, popular culture, and rebellion; bureaucracy, corruption, and social connections (guanxi); and overseas Chinese and the Chinese diasporas. In addition to reading classic and contemporary works of China anthropology, students will watch some highly selected films and documentaries on China. No knowledge of the Chinese language is required.",
