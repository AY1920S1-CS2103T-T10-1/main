    "description": "This course explores anthropological perspectives on how human rights\ndiscourses are produced and used in the world today. While the modern\nidea of human rights was only formalized in the aftermath of the Second\nWorld War, since that time, human rights discourses have spread around\nthe world and been adopted transnationally by widely varying actors.\nStarting from the premise that the transnational discourse of rights must\nbe understood in local contexts, we will explore the meaning and use of\nhuman rights from different perspectives.",
