    "description": "This course examines the various aspects of parental influence on\nchildren\u2019s development, with a focus on cultural differences in parenting\nstyles and practices. Topics to be covered include a critical evaluation of\nthe conceptual and functional differences of parenting practices across\ncultures, and how these may influence children\u2019s development in diverse\ncontexts. The notion of \u201cgood enough parenting\u201d and parenting as a bidirectional\nprocess will be analysed. The course concludes with a\ndiscussion of whether parents are the most important source of\ninfluence, considering the many other domains of influence in children\u2019s\nlives, such as peers.",
