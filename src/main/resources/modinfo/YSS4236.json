    "description": "The field of medical anthropology boasts a rich theoretical and empirical\ntradition, in which award-winning ethnographies have been written on\ntopics ranging from local biology to structural violence. Guided by the\nkey text, Medical Anthropology at the Intersections: Histories, Activisms,\nand Futures, this course will explore the canonical works of a number of\nleading medical anthropologists, including several whose research\nfocuses on Asia (e.g., Das, Kleinman, Lock). Three key themes will be\nexplored: 1) structural violence and social suffering; 2) technoscience and\nembodiment; and 3) medicine and humanitarianism.",
