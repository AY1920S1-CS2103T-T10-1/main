    "description": "What means sustainable development and how can it be financed? We\ninvestigate the changing visions, approaches, and experiences of\ndevelopment in Asia. We focus on the political economy and the policies\nleading to growth and its inequality and wellbeing impacts. We analyze the\nrole of (international) state, business, and civil society actors.\nOne illustration of such ideational and financial influences will be microfinance.\nAwarded the Nobel Prize for its role in poverty alleviation and\nwomen\u00b4s empowerment, it increasingly made negative headlines. Does\nmicro-finance provide a feasible market-driven solution? How does\nglobalization and liberalization influence other new approaches to\nsustainable development?",
