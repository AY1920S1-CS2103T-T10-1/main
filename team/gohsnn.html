<h2 id="about-jarvis"><a class="link" href="#about-jarvis">About Jarvis</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jarvis is the product of the team project by my
<a href="https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html">team</a> of 4 software engineering
students and I under the <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg">School of Computing,
National University of Singapore</a> module CS2103T Software Engineering. We were
tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface (CLI) desktop address-book
application, and we decided to morph it into an all encompassing student life
organiser which enables students to track and manage their tasks, finances,
co-curricular activities (CCAs) and courses taken at NUS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As students, we often need to access many different applications daily in order
to manage individual aspects of our life. Our team hopes that Jarvis will make
things easier for students by providing a platform that consolidates the most
important features. Therefore, Jarvis has 4 separate features for each concern
faced by students: Planner, Finance Tracker, Cca Tracker, and Course Planner.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="about-finance-tracker"><a class="link" href="#about-finance-tracker">About Finance Tracker</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this project, I was in charge of implementing the Finance Tracker feature,
which keeps track of the user&#8217;s purchases and monthly subscriptions (aka
installments), as well as total monthly expenditure and remaining budget if the
user has added a monthly spending limit for himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shown below is the graphical user interface (GUI) of Jarvis. Our application consists
of 4 different tabs - one for each of the above-mentioned features. The
application is currently at the Finance Tracker tab, which is underlined in red.
When the user enters a command in the command box, Jarvis will return a response
(whether his command was successfully executed, or if not, why it was rejected)
in the result box.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. The graphical user interface for Jarvis under the Finance Tracker tab</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to developing both the front-end and back-end of the Finance
Tracker feature, I also contributed to adopting the original version of the
developer&#8217;s guide as well as most of the diagrams in the final developer guide.
The following sections will illustrate these enhancements in more details as
well as the relevant documentation in the user and developer guides in relation
to these enhancements.</p>

<h4 id="description-of-enhancement"><a class="link" href="#description-of-enhancement">Description of enhancement</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned above, I was in charge of the Finance Tracker feature. This
allowed the users to be able to track their purchases and monthly installments,
as well as track the amount that they are spending with respect to the limit
they have set for themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users are able to add, delete, and find purchases as well as add, delete, and
edit installments. In addition, they can set a monthly spending limit for
themselves. Our application will then keep track of their total spending and
send warnings when their spending limit is close to being reached or has been
exceeded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="justification"><a class="link" href="#justification">Justification</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As university students, we are expected to take care of more finances such as
monthly phone bills and credit card bills. Furthermore, we have a lot of daily
purchases that we might easily lose track of. Thus, the Finance Tracker feature
will allow the user to better manage his monthly spendings and ensure he does
not overspend unknowingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For his convenience, the user does not need to add the date of purchase as
Jarvis will automatically tag today&#8217;s date to the user&#8217;s purchase. Each
installment subscription fee is also only added to the total monthly
expenditure once.</p>

<p>In addition, I revised the overall user interface to change the order of the
tabs. This increased the cohesiveness of the application from the perspective
of a student using Jarvis, according to the frequency that they would access
each feature. This can be viewed from pull request

<p>In addition, my code for the Finance Tracker feature I implemented was taken by
my team mate to adopt for his Cca Tracker feature. This was due to the
extensive OOP I had practiced throughout my code, which he also thought was a
good design to follow. This can be seen from pull request

adding the use cases, non-functional requirements as well as glossary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the latest version of the developer guide, I was responsible for most of the
class, activity and sequence diagrams for the entire team. While there were

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Finance Tracker feature closely follows the extendable OOP solution already
implemented within AB3. In the Finance Tracker, the <code>Installment</code> objects and
the <code>Purchase</code> objects manage most aspects related to this feature, along with
a single <code>MonthlyLimit</code> object. <code>Installment</code> and <code>Purchase</code> objects are stored
in their respective <code>ObservableList</code> - <code>InstallmentList</code> and <code>PurchaseList</code>,
which provide an abstraction with <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, and <code>set</code> operations that
are called by <code>FinanceTracker</code> and its model.</p>

<h3 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design Considerations</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When designing the implementation of the Finance Tracker feature, I had to
think of the best way to create and manage the various objects in the Finance
Tracker as there were many sub-components. Thus, I had to consider whether to
encapsulate the fields of the <code>Installment</code> and <code>Purchase</code> objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-choice"><a class="link" href="#current-choice">Current choice</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our current choice was to encapsulate the constituent objects in <code>Installment</code>
and <code>Purchase</code> objects in their own wrapper classes. As mentioned above,
<code>Installment</code> would contain <code>InstallmentDescription</code> and <code>InstallmentMoneyPaid</code>
objects while <code>Purchase</code> would contain <code>PurchaseDescription</code> and
<code>PurchaseMoneySpent</code> objects. The following is the analysis surrounding this
design choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pros: Increases OOP (hides implementation; increases extensibility and
maintainability of objects)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cons: Major changes to current code base; steep increase in code due to greater
abstraction</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="alternative"><a class="link" href="#alternative">Alternative</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The alternative would have been to leave the corresponding fields as
primitive data types. This would have been the easier alternative at the time
as it was the original implementation. Furthermore, since the <code>Installment</code>
and <code>Purchase</code> objects were not extremely complex, further encapsulation might
not have been imperative.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="our-thoughts"><a class="link" href="#our-thoughts">Our Thoughts</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking the long-term vision of the application to be continuously developed
into consideration, I decided to increase OOP as much as possible. The decision
was also based on following good software engineering principles.</p>
