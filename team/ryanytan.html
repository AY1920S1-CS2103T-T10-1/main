<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jarvis was developed by <a href="https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t10-1.github.io/main/AboutUs.html">AY1920-CS2103T-T10-1</a>. We are a team
based in the <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg">School of Computing, National University of Singapore</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team of 5 students in a Software Engineering module, including myself, was
tasked with enhancing a program named <a href="https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/">AddressBook</a>. AddressBook is
a basic desktop application that features a Command Line Interface (CLI)
style of input - meaning that a mouse is used minimally in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We chose to enhance AddressBook into a Student Lifestyle application named
<strong>Jarvis</strong>. Jarvis is meant to be able to manage many aspects of a regular
university student&#8217;s life - anywhere from finances to university course
planning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shown below is the UI of Jarvis, showing my feature:</p>

<p>My role in the development of Jarvis was the Course Planner feature. This

Jarvis, along with the challenges I have faced, plus any other contributions I

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The feature I have provided within Jarvis is a <strong>Course Planner</strong> - using this
feature you are able to plan out, look up and check information about any
course currently offered within the National University of Singapore. This is
one of the big features (out of 4) of Jarvis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Jarvis is an integrated system with the focus of a Student Lifestyle
tool targeted towards University students, streamlining course planning
was determined to be a natural feature that this application should provide.
The Course Planner allows an NUS student to keep track of their courses that
they have taken and the courses they are taking, so that they can make
more informed choices on the courses they wish to taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of this feature was not as simple as expected. This is
due to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Implementing a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> data structure that I had not learnt
before in previous modules. Thus, research had to be done on how to
create this data structure. I eventually had to come up with my own
implementation using the new knowledge gained from my research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of the large amount of data from University courses proved
challenging as many approaches could be taken to manage the data. This is
mainly in terms of the data&#8217;s storage and retrieval while the app was
running, where a poor solution could result in program freezes in the order of
seconds, which would be detrimental to the user experience.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually, a reasonable solution the problem was reached after considering
a few avenues, that was relatively neat and had good performance.</p>

<p><strong>Testability and Code Quality</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Refactored a <code>ModelStub</code> class that was being duplicated throughout the
codebase <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/131">#131</a></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>ModelStub</code> is a stub class used for testing. As we developed our
own features, any updates to <code>Model</code> had to be reflected in <code>ModelStub</code>. Since
we had five different features, each changing <code>Model</code>, we had to edit every
instance of <code>ModelStub</code> in the code. Eventually, it got very tiresome and
I removed all static inner-class instances and refactored it into its own
class for easier reuse.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added additional compiler flags into our <code>gradle</code> build
<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/108">#108</a>.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was added as some of us had pushed code that was using deprecated API.
This change allowed the compiler to warn us if we were using deprecated API,
along with any warnings related to Java Generics.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactored <code>CliSyntax</code> <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/110">#110</a></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>CliSyntax</code> is a class used to indicate different inputs into a command. So, in
a command with the syntax <code>add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER</code>, <code>n/</code> and <code>p/</code> are
considered "CLI Syntax". Our team faced an issue where we had to reuse
some syntax since similar ones thematically fit into our own individual
features. For easier referencing and to avoid clashes, the team lead asked me
to refactor the relevant constants into their own static classes for easy
importing.</p>

<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Implemented switching using <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/193/commits/b8326f689ff2ad94354b3cb846a776619000e417">b832</a> <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/319/commits/4d9f595bf7495cc0d0ad6d9091cc07a9d5a54ecd">4d9f</a></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Jarvis primarily uses the keyboard, I implemented tab-switching using
the keyboard with the <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> key, instead of having to either type a command
or use the mouse. I felt that this made the user experience more seamless and
in line with the target audience&#8217;s (fast typists used to a Command Line
Interface) preferences.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implemented Command-Box highlighting <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/330/commits/8cf01071c3d6a3f6d268cab8bca183f1041731ba">8cf0</a></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The colour scheme we had gone with in Jarvis did not allow us to highlight the
text of wrong commands without it looking unappealing. Thus, I made the UI
show a red highlighted box instead, as shown below:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an attempt to streamline the user experience even further, I implemented
pressing <code>&lt;ENTER&gt;</code> to automatically focus on the command box. This means that
the user will not have to use their mouse to click the command box.</p>

<li>
<p>Implemented Styling for User Interface <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-1/main/pull/330">#330</a></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along with the help of another team member who worked on the layout, I did
the styling seen in the application - such as the way the tabs look, the
colour scheme of individual components and general look and feel of the UI.</p>

<p>The <code>AndOrTree&lt;R&gt;</code> is a tree data structure served by the <code>util/andor</code> package
that provides an abstraction for processing the prerequisite tree.  The
prerequisite tree (henceforth referred to as <code>prereqTree</code>) is an attribute of a
<code>Course</code> that is available in the NUSMod&#8217;s course data-set, the data comes in
the form of a <code>String</code> and will be covered shortly.</p>

<h6 id="the-code-andornode-code-class"><a class="link" href="#the-code-andornode-code-class">The <code>AndOrNode</code> Class</a></h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each node in the tree of type <code>R</code> is represented by an <code>AndOrNode&lt;R&gt;</code>. Every
node has a <code>List&lt;AndOrNode&lt;R&gt;&gt;</code>, to be used in checking the truth condition
of the tree, and every node is either an <code>AndNode</code>, <code>OrNode</code> or <code>DataNode</code>
node. This determines the conditional used to check the truth condition of a
node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The truth condition of a node is determined using the method:
<code>boolean fulfills(Collection&lt;R&gt;)</code>. This checks the truth condition of the node
based on the following predicates:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The node is an <code>AndNode</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any subset of elements in <code>Collection&lt;R&gt;</code> must match all children of this
node.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The node is an <code>OrNode</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any element in <code>Collection&lt;R&gt;</code> must match at least one of the children of this
node.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The node is a <code>DataNode</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any element in <code>Collection&lt;R&gt;</code> must match the data stored in this node.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, an <code>AndNode&lt;String&gt;</code> with children <code>{"1", "2", "3"}</code> will match <code>true</code>

of <code>{"2", "3"}</code>.</p>

<li>
<p><code>fulfills(Collection&lt;R&gt;)</code></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the arbitrary ordering of the tree, <code>insert()</code> and <code>delete()</code> operations
commonly found in implementations of ordered trees are difficult to implement.

<p><code>AndOrTree</code> posed some difficulty for us, in the decision to couple the
implementation of <code>AndOrTree</code> with <code>Course</code>. This is because the tree will
only ever be used by the Course Planner within the program, and thus it is
not required to implement the tree using generics. Below are our considerations
in implementing this data structure:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Option 1: Couple <code>AndOrTree</code> to <code>Course</code></strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that there is no need to pass any mapper function into the
<code>buildTree()</code> method as the class does not need to know how to map from <code>String</code>
to <code>R</code>. This also makes handling mapping exceptions easier as they can be
handled directly by <code>Course</code> instead of by <code>AndOrTree</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this increases coupling between the tree and <code>Course</code>, which reduces
testability of <code>AndOrTree</code>. The tree
will also only be locked to <code>Course</code> and is non-extendable.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option 2: Using Generics</strong></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes the tree reusable in the future. The tree will also
be able to store any data-type which allows for easier unit testing, since
it won&#8217;t be dependent on the correctness of <code>Course</code>. Instead, well-tested
libraries such as Java&#8217;s <code>String</code> API can be used to test the class instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, due to how the tree is built, a
mapper function must be passed into the <code>buildTree()</code> method to process
the string in each node to the generic type of the tree.</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to its benefits far outweighing its disadvantages, we picked the second
choice of using generics. While extendability and re-usability of the class is
a nice bonus, the decrease in coupling and increase in testability was the
deciding factor in choosing between these two approaches.</p>
